Cross-sectoral analysis of water usage in Thailand using input–output model,"Chulalongkorn University, Thammasat University",2022,"© 2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Thailand currently ranks third among the most water-intensive countries in the world. The percentage shares of water demand in the country’s agriculture, manufacturing, and service sectors, which are major economic sectors, are 75%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. With the continuous growth of the economy, the demand for water is steadily rising, while the expansion of water supply remains constrained by several factors and the water supply is also affected by climate change. This study uses the input–output model to examine the relationship between water usage and the economic system in Thailand in 2010. The constructed input–output model is the integration of the Leontief inverse matrix, the matrix of water usage, and the details of the gross domestic product (GDP). The model indicates the linkage between GDP expansion and water demand in both direct and indirect usage. The computation result obtained from the model indicates that the agricultural sector is the major water user, with its ratio of direct water use being the highest. The manufacturing sector records the highest ratio of indirect water use, which is influenced by its supply chain comprising the agriculture and service sectors. This model and its results may serve as the main foundation for the design of economic and environmental policies oriented toward optimizing water demand and supply. The model can also be extended and enriched with detailed mechanisms of economic behavior to allow further complex analyzes such as water pricing policies."
Relationships between causal factors affecting future carbon dioxide output from Thailand's transportation sector under the government's sustainability policy: Expanding the SEM-VECM model,Chulalongkorn University,2020,"© 2019 by the authors.This research aims to analyze the relationships between causal factors likely to affect future CO2 emissions from the Thai transportation sector by developing the Structural Equation Modeling-Vector Autoregressive Error Correction Mechanism Model (SEM-VECM Model). This model was created to fill information gaps of older models. In addition, the model provides the unique feature of viable model application for different sectors in various contexts. The model revealed all exogenous variables that have direct and indirect influences over changes in CO2 emissions. The variables show a direct effect at a confidence interval of 99%, including per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1), labor growth (Δln(L)t-1), urbanization rate factor (Δln(URT)t-1), industrial structure (Δln(IS)t-1), energy consumption (Δln(EC)t-1), foreign direct investment (Δln(FDI)t-1), oil price (Δln(OP)t-1), and net exports (Δln(X - E)t-1). In addition, it was found that every variable in the SEM-VECM model has an indirect effect on changes in CO2 emissions at a confidence interval of 99%. The SEM-VECM model has the ability to adjust to the equilibrium equivalent to 39%. However, it also helps to identify the degree of direct effect that each causal factor has on the others. Specifically, labor growth (Δln(L)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1) and energy consumption (Δln(EC)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%, while urbanization rate (Δln(URT)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1), labor growth (Δln(L)t-1), and net exports (Δln(X - E)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%. Furthermore, industrial structure (Δln(IS)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%, whereas energy consumption (Δln(EC)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%. Foreign direct investment (Δln(FDI)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%, while oil price (Δln(OP)t-1) had a direct effect on industrial structure (Δln(IS)t-1), energy consumption (Δln(EC)t-1), and net exports (Δln(X - E)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%. Lastly, net exports (Δln(X - E)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%. The model eliminates the problem of heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity, and autocorrelation. In addition, it was found that the model is white noise. When the SEM-VECM Model was used for 30-year forecasting (2018-2047), it projected that CO2 emissions would increase steadily by 67.04% (2047/2018) or 123.90 Mt CO2 Eq. by 2047. The performance of the SEM-VECM Model was assessed and produced a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.21% and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.02%. When comparing the performance value with the values of other, older models, the SEM-VECM Model was found to be more effective and useful for future research and policy planning for Thailand's sustainability goals."
A Study on the Evaluation Tendency of Thermal Sensation in Tropical Region - Targeting short time residents - Targeting s,"Chulalongkorn University, Sugiyama Jogakuen University, Meijo University, Kure National College of Technology, Osaka Prefecture University, Ariake National College of Technology, JR East Design Corporation",2022,"© 2018 Web Portal IOP. All rights reserved.Climate change is getting more and more serious issue in the world. This is known as caused by the increase of carbon dioxide. To stop the increase, many countries agreed to the Paris Agreement in 2015. When to discuss the climate change, temperature drop and increase are focused more often. The big change of the temperature, especially the rise of the temperature, causes the more usage of air conditioning system, and it also causes more energy consumption. In addition, the usage of the air conditioning system is affected by both indoor and outdoor thermal environment. The temperature setting of air conditioning system tends to be lower in the countries situated in tropical region than the countries in the other region. This happens because the thermal sensation of human is easily affected by the outdoor environment. For that reason, to grasp the tendency of thermal sensation in outdoor space is important. In addition, the tendency of short time residence is necessary to wipe out the influence of the thermal environment adjustment by long time living. For that reason, this research targeted the thermal evaluation tendency of short time residents in Bangkok and carried out subject experiments in outdoor spaces to develop landscape design method. As the result of analysis, a different tendency was grasped at one of the measuring points with open sky."
A Study on the Effect of Environment Sound on Human Thermal Sensation,"Kyushu Sangyo University, Sugiyama Jogakuen University, Chulalongkorn University, Meijo University, Kure National College of Technology, Osaka Prefecture University, Ariake National College of Technology, JR East Design Corporation",2022,"© 2018 Web Portal IOP. All rights reserved.In recent years, there have been several devastations caused by the global climate change. Global climate change is considered as relating to the global warming and is becoming a serious problem. Global warming is related to the increase of carbon dioxide. The increase of the carbon dioxide is caused by the energy consumption increase. In addition, air conditioning dominates the large ratio of the energy consumption. Furthermore, according to the huge earthquake happened on March 11, 2011 in Japan, the country's energy policy is facing a turning point, which is to establish less harmful and less energy based society than ever. For that reason, to decrease the energy consumption, how to reduce the energy consumption by the air-conditioning is an important issue. There have been several research relating to the topic. However, those researches did not study on the effect of the environment sound on the human thermal sensation. For that reason, the purpose of this research is to clarify the effect of environment sound on human thermal sensation. As the result of this study, the environment sounds, such as ""Rain"" ""Stream"" ""Water Bamboo"" showed the effect to lower the human thermal sensation."
Water balance of pine forests: Synthesis of new and published results,"Chulalongkorn University, Duke University, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), University of Helsinki, Indiana University, USDA Forest Service Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, SLU",2023,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.The forest hydrologic cycle is expected to have important feedback responses to climate change, impacting processes ranging from local water supply and primary productivity to global water and energy cycles. Here, we analyzed water budgets of pine forests worldwide. We first estimated local water balance of forests dominated by two wide-ranging species: Pinus taeda (36 °N) and Pinus sylvestris (64 °N). In these stands, growing season evapotranspiration (ET) was largely insensitive to inter-annual variation of precipitation (P), consistent with the insensitivity of canopy transpiration to P. Extending the analyses to include published data from 117 studies on 27 pine species, we found that pine forests annually use ∼66% ± 17% (SD) of P as ET, regardless of climatic regime, leaving a third of P as runoff to downstream aquatic ecosystems and users. However, during the growing season, pine forests used more water as ET than P in regions where P ≤ 326 ± 39 (SE) mm. Forests in regions of low growing season P exist in their current state only where the rooting depth is sufficient to supply trees with water from soil storage in addition to P, and these forests are likely to support only ephemeral streams that dry down during the growing season. Thus, globally, water use by pine forests is adapted to mean annual P, but shows a limited capacity to respond to inter-annual variability in P. Forests with a small buffer of growing season water availability (P + soil water storage - ET), are likely to be most sensitive to variation in P regimes, changing canopy leaf area, tree density, and species composition depending on the degree, direction and persistence of the change in P."

An assessment of the longevity of samarium cobalt trioxide perovskite catalyst during the conversion of greenhouse gases into syngas,"Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Universiti Malaysia Pahang, University of Benin, University Malaysia Terengganu, Chulalongkorn University",2021,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdCatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reforming of methane (CH4) has gained interest because it reduces the amount of greenhouse gases in the environment. In addition, the products from the reforming process are utilized as feedstock in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. However, rapid catalyst deactivation and sintering due to carbon deposition often accompany the CO2 reforming of CH4 reaction. In this study, samarium cobalt trioxides perovskite catalyst was synthesized and employed as catalyst in a 72 h longevity test conducted at 1073 K using CO2 to reform CH4 with gas-hourly-space velocity of 30,000 h−1. Feed ratios (0.5–2.0) were varied and excellent catalytic longevity, maximum conversion (above 90%) and yield (above 60%), were obtained at 1.0 feed ratio. Physicochemical properties of the fresh catalyst revealed uniform metallic particles distribution on a single phase perovskite structure, while spent catalyst showed evidence of carbon which was graphitic at 0.5–1.33 feed ratio with C–C and C–H bonds, and formed contaminant of carbon at 2.0 feed ratio with O–C[dbnd]O bond."
Liver fluke-associated biliary tract cancer,Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine,2021,"© 2018 Editorial Office of Gut and Liver. All rights reserved.Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive cancer arising from epithelial cells of the bile duct. Most patients with CCA have an unresectable tumor at the time of diagnosis. In Western countries, the risk of CCA increases in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, whereas liver fluke infection appears to be the major risk factor for CCA in Asian countries. A diagnosis of liver fluke infection often relies on stool samples, including microscopic examination, polymerase chain reaction-based assays, and fluke antigen detection. Tests of serum, saliva and urine samples are also potentially diagnostic. The presence of liver fluke along with exogenous carcinogens magnifies the risk of CCA in people living in endemic areas. The ""liver fluke-cholangiocarcinoma"" carcinogenesis pathways consist of mechanical damage to the bile duct epithelium, immunopathologic and cellular reactions to the liver fluke's antigens and excretory/secretory products, liver fluke-induced changes in the biliary tract microbiome and the effects of repeated treatment for liver fluke. A vaccine and novel biomarkers are needed for the primary and secondary prevention of CCA in endemic areas. Importantly, climate change exerts an effect on vector-borne parasitic diseases, and awareness of liver fluke should be enhanced in potentially migrated habitat areas."
Potential of carbon dioxide storage from petroleum industries in the Gulf of Thailand for green production,Chulalongkorn University,2020,"© 2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Recently, climate change and global warming are the global concern because of an increase in the huge amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. This gas comes from energy activities and industries like petroleum industries. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the practical technology to reduce and storage CO2. In Thailand, one of the main potential sites for storage is the Gulf of Thailand. However, the research on this issue is very rare in Thailand. Consequently, this work is aiming on the potential study of CO2 geological storage in formations in the Gulf of Thailand by using simulation. The CO2 storage capacity, pressure buildup and plume migration have been estimated. Also, this study has been simulated with various conditions. CO2 injection is used from 1,000-4,000 tons per day with the depth from 2,200-2,330 meters and the results are studied for 50 years as a monitoring period. The results present that with the formation characteristics, CO2 storage in this area has potential. Moreover, pressure buildup and plume migration are illustrated for the period of 50 years. As a fundamental knowledge, this study can contribute to CO2 storage in an offshore area in Thailand."
Key factors of low carbon development strategy for sustainable transport,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Cities become more vulnerable to climate change impacts causing by urbanization, economic growth, increasing of energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. People who live in the cities have already been affected from the impacts in terms of socioeconomic and environmental aspects. Sustainable transport plays the key role in CO2 mitigation and contributes positive impacts on sustainable development for the cities. Several studies in megacities both in developed and developing countries support that mass transit system is an important transportation mode in CO2 mitigation and sustainable transport development. This paper aims to study key factors of low carbon development strategy for sustainable transport. The Bangkok Mass Rapid Transit System (MRT) located in Bangkok was the study area. Data collection was using semi-structured in-depth interview protocol with thirty respondents consisting of six groups i.e. governmental agencies, the MRT operators, consulting companies, international organizations, non-profit organizations, and experts. The research findings highlighted the major factors and supplemental elements composing of institution and technical capacity, institutional framework, policy setting and process, and plan of implementation that would support more effective strategic process for low carbon development strategy (LCDS) for sustainable transport. The study would highly recommend on readiness of institution and technical capacities, stakeholder mapping, high-level decision- makers participation, and a clear direction of the governmental policies that are strongly needed in achieving the sustainable transport."
"Properties and performance of microemulsion fuel: blending of jatropha oil, diesel, and ethanol- surfactant","Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Phutthamonthon, Khlong Luang, Pathumwan",2022,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdTo assure energy security source, a renewable nonedible plant such as Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) is attractive as a feedstock. However, the high viscosity of this vegetable oil is the main limitation on its fuel properties and makes it unsuitable for direct application in current diesel engines. Microemulsification is an alternative method for fuel production that reduces the by-products from the transesterification process. In this research, microemulsion fuels (MFs) were produced from crude JCO, diesel and ethanol in the presence of a surfactant. Three formulations of MFs with various composition of diesel and an ethanol-surfactant ratio were examined in terms of their biodiesel characteristics, performance and emission levels. For instance MF(E5), MF(E5)-LS1 and MF(E10)-LS1 were MFs without surfactant, ME with 5% and 10% of the ethanol-surfactant component, respectively. The high heating value, kinematic viscosity and water content of the MFs were close to the biodiesel standard and compatible for use with diesel engines. In addition, the MF(E5), gave an engine power, brake specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature similar to those of petroleum-derived diesel. The emissions from these MFs showed a lower smoke emission than that of diesel, while the CO and CO2 emissions were similar to those of diesel. Thus MF(E5) showed great potential for use as biofuel with less exhaust smoke emission in diesel engines without modification."

Furthermore, a comprehensive survey on the future perspective of membrane technologies as a potential solution for CO2 removal and utilization is provided."
Cryopreservation of sperm from the coral Acropora humilis,"Chulalongkorn University, Mingdao University, Mingdao University, National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium, National Dong Hwa University",2023,"© 2017 Elsevier Inc.Corals are sensitive to minute changes in their environments, and their continued existence is substantially threatened by the increasing number of destructive anthropogenic activities and unprecedented rates of climate change. Although cryopreservation has been successfully to preserve mammalian gametes for decades, coral cryopreservation was attempted for the first time less than 15 years ago, and freezing protocols exist for only a handful of coral species. The present study developed a cryopreservation protocol for the sperm of the common Indo-Pacific reef-builder Acropora humilis. Colonies of reefs of Sattahip Bay, Chonburi Province, Thailand were collected from 3 m depth with a mesh net during a spawning event. Immediately after collection, the sperm were isolated and subjected to a two-step freezing method featuring DMSO, polyethylene glycol, or methanol as the cryoprotectant. Viability and motility were assessed via a bioluminescence technique and a “computer-assisted semen analysis, and it was found that a 15-min equilibration with 2 M DMSO followed by cooling at 41.7 °C was the optimum cryopreservation protocol for A. humilis sperm. The post-thaw sperm achieved 45% fertilization success, and 35% of the fertilized eggs developed into blastopore larvae. The present optimized protocol can therefore facilitate the preservation of sperm for future propagation efforts of this species and provide an experimental platform for optimizing cryopreservation protocols for gametes of other scleractinian coral species."
"Flow budget change of groundwater system under climate change in the upper central plain, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University,2020,"© 2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.The Upper Central Plain of Thailand, where farmers depended on both surface water and groundwater. Water allocated from the Bhumibol and Sirikit Dams are limited and caused water shortage in the dry years. Most farmers turn to use groundwater to supplement irrigation water in the dry years. This study aims to understand the flow budget change of groundwater under climate change scenario. The conjunctive use ratio of surfaceas well as groundwater were investigated by field surveys and groundwater flow modeling, using the MODFLOW model to simulate the groundwater movement over the 10 years. The study used the bias-corrected MRI-GCM data to project the future climate conditions (during 2015 -2029 and 2075-2089) and assess the impact on flow budget change of groundwater system. The conjunctive use ratio were analyzed from surface water use and flow budget of groundwater system in term of water demand, rainfall, reservoir storage, groundwater recharge, groundwater storage, groundwater pumping. The study shows the flow budget change and conjunctive use ratio of each season and water year in the past and in the future under climate change scenarios."
The influence of building envelop materials on its life cycle performance: A case study of educational building in Thailand,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, National Metal and Materials Technology Center, Thammasat University Rangsit Campus",2020,"© 2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.The analysis of life cycle energy (LCE) and life cycle carbon (LCC) of building were performed in this study in order to identify the solutions for reducing energy-related carbon emission throughout building life time. The influence factors associated with building envelop materials (wall, insulation, window, window-to-wall ratio) were evaluated. The result showed that operation phase contributed a vast majority (>90%) of LCE and LCC. Only 4% emissions saving could be achieved if autoclaved aerated concrete block, cellulose insulation and triple glazing were implemented with WWR of 0.17. The finding suggested that reducing carbon emission should not only be prioritized through use of high energy efficient materials/technologies but should also integrate energy saving measures since energy demand in tropical country is quite high for cooling building. In addition, increasing a possibility and feasibility for supplying renewable energy should be further investigated importunately."
CO2 geological storage coupled with water alternating gas for enhanced oil recovery,Chulalongkorn University,2020,"Copyright © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.Due to the climate change and global warming, the concern about CO2 emission into the atmosphere has been raised in many industries such as oil and gas business. The sources of CO2 include natural gas processing and other processes. The current technology to mitigate CO2 is carbon capture, storage and utilisation. At the same time, oil production is expected to increase due to the higher consumption. CO2 geological storage in depleting oilfield coupled with enhanced oil recovery can be a better technology to meet both requirements. The excellent example of this technology is the Weyburn Project in Canada that can store CO2 and produce more oil as well as prolong the reservoir life. From this successful project, the technology is studied by applying it with the depleting oilfield for both oil production and CO2 storage in the North of Thailand by using simulation model. It becomes the objective of this research, which is to evaluate CO2 geological storage coupled with water alternating gas (WAG) for enhanced oil recovery as well as to study the effects the parameters, such as total hydrocarbon pore volume (HCPV) injection and WAG ratio, on oil production and CO2 consumption and sequestration for enhanced oil recovery, with the added benefit of carbon sequestration. CMG software from Computer Modeling Group Ltd. is used to create the 3D simulation model to predict the CO2 storage in the geological formation. From the simulation, the results reported that oil can be produced up to 125,976 m3 of oil or 57 % recovery, CO2 consumption is 66,261 m3 of gas and CO2 utilisation is approximately 0.53 m3 of gas per m3 of oil. The main parameters for WAG process is WAG ratio in that oil production increases as WAG ratio increases. CO2 consumption increases with total HCPV injection. The results of this study can be applied to develop the CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in the depleting oilfield in the North of Thailand for both oil production and CO2 storage."
Mixture of MEA/2-MAE for effective CO2 capture from flue gas stream,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2020,"Copyright © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.The climate change and global warming are the main environmental concerns because of CO2 emission into the atmosphere. The main sources of CO2 is from power plants in the form of flue gas. Recently, the effective technology to capture CO2 is chemical absorption by using aqueous amine solutions. The commonly used amine solution is monoethanolamine (MEA). It has disadvantages like low capacity and high energy consumption. 2-methylaminoethanol (2-MAE) as a new solvent has been formulated to improve the performance of CO2 mitigation but the cost of this chemical is higher. The two amines are mixed together to obtain higher performance and to compensate the drawbacks of each solvents. The objective of this research is to measure the solubility of CO2 in a mixed solvent with 20: 10 wt% of MEA and 2-MAE for CO2 capture from the flue gas stream at the temperature of 313.15 K and 353.15 K and CO2 partial pressures ranging from 5 to 100 kPa. The experimental results are compared with that of single solution of MEA and 2-MAE at the same conditions. From the results, it is reported that in term of cyclic capacity, the amine mixture provides a better performance, which is higher than that of MEA ranging from 2.35 % to 61.90 % but lower than that of 2-MAE from 8.76 % to 43.45 %. The rate of CO2 loading of mixed solution is relatively close to that of MEA but lower than that of 2-MAE. Therefore, in the future, the mixed solvent may be used as an alternative solution for CO2 capture instead of using single amine."
"Leaf litter decomposition in headwater streams, nam nao national park, Thailand","Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen University, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2018, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment. All rights reserved.Objectives of this research are to investigate long-term responses of leaf litter decomposition rates involved some abiotic factors and colonized macroinvertebrates in leaf litter bags at headwater streams, Nam Nao National Park by comparing data between 2002 and 2014. Three grams dry weight of Bambusa arundinacea Willd. was put in an individual nylon bag and they were placed in riffles and pools at 2 streams. These litter bags from each stream were retrieved every 2 weeks of immersion. Results showed that leaf breakdown rates were more rapidly in riffle than in pool and the rate was faster at Phromlaeng stream than those of Yakruae stream in both years. Increasing of water velocity was considered to increase leaf decay. Macroinvertebrates colonizing in the leaf litter bags was similar in 2002 and 2014. In both years, Dipteran and Ephemeropteran larvae were the most abundant (more than 50%) in the litter bags throughout the study, which were primarily collector-gatherers in the leaf litter bags. Shredders directly consumed leaves and other coarse particle organic matters were low abundance. Collector-filters were more abundant in riffle. Scrappers and predators did not feed on detritus, but they utilized the litter bag for shelter. In conclusion, decomposition rate was more rapidly caused by increasing water velocity. Increase in water velocity was a consequence of increase in precipitation which was directly related to climate change."

Elemental composition of biochar obtained from agriculturalwaste for soil amendment and carbon sequestration,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2019 by the authors.For an agricultural country such as Thailand, converting agricultural waste into biochar offers a potential solution to manage massive quantities of crop residues following harvest. This research studied the structure and chemical composition of biochar obtained from cassava rhizomes, cassava stems and corncobs, produced using a patented locally-manufactured biochar kiln using low-cost appropriate technology designed to be fabricated locally by farmers. The research found that cassava stems yielded the highest number of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area in the biochar product, while chemical analysis indicated that corncobs yielded the highest amount of C (81.35%). The amount of H in the corncob biochar was also the highest (2.42%). The study also showed biochar produced by slow pyrolysis was of a high quality, with stable C and low H/C ratio. Biochar's high BET surface area and total pore volume makes it suitable for soil amendment, contributing to reduced soil density, higher soil moisture and aeration and reduced leaching of plant nutrients from the rhizosphere. Biochar also provides a conducive habitat for beneficial soil microorganisms. The findings indicate that soil incorporation of biochar produced from agricultural crop residues can enhance food security and mitigate the contribution of the agricultural sector to climate change impacts."
"Financial development, market freedom, political stability, economic growth and CO2 emissions: An unexplored nexus in asean countries","Taylor’s University, Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2019, University of Economics and Human Sciences in Warsaw and Vistula University. All rights reserved.The prime objective of the current study is to explore the nexus among financial development, market freedom, political stability, economic growth and CO2 emissions in ASEAN countries. The present study has attempted to examine the asymmetric association among financial development, CO2 emissions, and economic growth. The data for the variables are obtained from the World Bank. The CO2 emission is measured in kilotons. The Johansen cointegration technique has been used for analyzing the long-term association. The results of the political freedom model indicate that in countries where there will be political stability, their CO2 emission will be low. A number of research papers have investigated the relationship between the environment and political freedom. A positive relationship has been found by most of the studies; however, these studies have not taken CO2 emissions into account. The probability of making agreements at international conferences is directly linked with the political freedom to lower the level of global pollutants. This study proves that the implementation of such agreements has started recently and a significant impact of political freedom on emissions cannot yet be finalized with the limited data available. Financial development appears to have a significant relationship with carbon emission. This study will be helpful for policymakers and researchers in understanding the issues related to financial development, market freedom, political stability, and economic growth and CO2 emissions in ASEAN countries."
Challenges of Energy Efficiency Promoting Policy in Thailand,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2019,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Energy efficiency enhancement is well recognized worldwide as the efficient measures to deal with energy-related challenges, which are economic growth and development, energy security, and climate change. For Thailand to accelerate energy efficiency implementation, the energy development plan is set to meet the national targets including the Energy Efficiency Plan target and to achieve the Greenhouse Gas emission reduction target. In many countries, financing energy efficiency promoting policy is critically important strategy to provide financial incentive for mitigating clean energy investment barrier. For long-term public support, there is an emerging body of evidence on the on-going practice and performance of the financial incentive programs, which offers an opportunity to improve our understanding of the energy efficiency promoting policy. This study reviewed the latest situation of three energy efficiency financial incentive programs that governed by Department of Alternative Energy Development and Energy Efficiency (DEDE), which are (1) Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund (EERF), (2) Energy Service Company Revolving Fund (ESCO Fund), (3) DEDE Demand Side Management Bidding (DSM Bidding). The study aims to examine the positive and negative challenges posed by existing policies that need to be overcome and to identify the opportunities for policy improvement to more effectively promote energy efficiency implementation. EERF and DSM Bidding are suitably designed for large company who has strong financial capacity. ESCO Fund is well-designed for low collateral capacity company. EE measures under EERF are mostly well-known technologies that are proven generating energy savings. ESCO Fund is suitable for promoting new technologies according to project-based analysing basis. DSM Bidding can be designed for wide-range EE measures from simple to complex measures. However, there are some main challenges that can be improved, i.e., technical and financial risks bearing by customers from EERF, default projects risk taken by government and insufficient to encourage EE investment of low interest rate from ESCO Fund, and expanding to support more for complex technology instead of only well-known technology for DSM Bidding."

All rights reserved.Well-developed in the context of climate change, the concept of adaptive capacity has so far not been applied extensively to the study of World Heritage management. This paper applies the analytic framework of adaptive capacity to better understand how institutional attributes enable or hinder systemic adaptation in managing World Heritage sites as boundaries of practice expand due to changing concepts of heritage and emerging management challenges. Drawing upon case studies from Southeast Asia, the study proposes a refined framework with the following dimensions of adaptive capacity: cognitive frames, learning capacity, resources, formal governance measures, organizational relationships, and agency."
Syngas production from combined steam gasification of biochar and a sorption-enhanced water-gas shift reaction with the utilization of CO2,"King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, Phayathai Road,Wang Mai, Pathumwan Institute of Technology, Pathumwan Institute of Technology, National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA), Chulalongkorn University",2020,"© 2019 by the authors.This research aims at evaluating the performance of a combined system of biochar gasification and a sorption-enhanced water-gas shift reaction (SEWGS) for synthesis gas production. The effects of mangrove-derived biochar gasification temperature, pattern of combined gasification and SEWGS, amount of steam and CO2 added as gasifying agent, and SEWGS temperature were studied in this work. The performances of the combined process were examined in terms of biochar conversion, gaseous product composition, and CO2 emission. The results revealed that the hybrid SEWGS using one-body multi-functional material offered a greater amount of H2 with a similar amount of CO2 emissions when compared with separated sorbent/catalyst material. The gasification temperature of 900 °C provided the highest biochar conversion of ca. 98.7%. Synthesis gas production was found to depend upon the amount of water and CO2 added and SEWGS temperature. Higher amounts of H2 were observed when increasing the amount of water and the temperature of the SEWGS system."
Appliance Classification Method Based on K-Nearest Neighbors for Home Energy Management System,"Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education, University of Architecture, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2019 IEEE.Saving energy is one of the biggest concerns nowadays in order to deal with lacking fossil fuel and climate change. One possible approach is using the Home Energy Management System (HEMS) to monitor and manage the electrical usage at residential user. One useful feature of HEMS is the capability of detecting and identifying electrical appliances in order to assign these appliances to join many saving energy programs such as Time-Of-Use or Demand Response. In this paper, we propose an appliance classification approach based on K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) technique. KNN is extensively used classification algorithm owing to its simplicity, ease of implementation and effectiveness. The inputs we used to calculate the Euclidean distance in KNN are the root mean square (RMS) of voltage, current and the active power of appliance. We also implement a HEMS prototype includes many smart plug-in devices and a MQTT server. The appliance classification results show that our KNN classifier can be a suitable approach for appliance classification feature of HEMS."
Multi-objective optimization of sorption enhanced steam biomass gasification with solid oxide fuel cell,"Chulalongkorn University, EPFL",2020,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdBiomass is one of the encouraging renewable energy sources to mitigate uncertainties in the future energy supply and to address the climate change caused by the increased CO2 emissions. Conventionally, thermal energy is produced from biomass via combustion process with low thermodynamic efficiency. Conversely, gasification of biomass integrated with innovative power generation technologies, such as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), offers much higher conversion efficiency. Typically, energy conversion process has multiple conflicting performance criteria, such as capital and operating costs, annual profit, thermodynamic performance and environment impact. Multi-objective Optimization (MOO) methods are used to found the optimal compromise in the objective function space, and also to acquire the corresponding optimal values of decision variables. This work investigates integration and optimization of a Sorption Enhanced Steam Biomass Gasification (SEG) with a SOFC and Gas Turbine (GT) system for the production of power and heat from Eucalyptus wood chips. The energy system model is firstly developed in Aspen Plus simulator, which has five main units: (1) SEG coupled with calcium looping for hydrogen-rich gas production, (2) hot gas cleaning and steam reforming, (3) SOFC-GT for converting hydrogen into electricity, (4) catalytic burning and CO2 compression, and (5) cement production from the purge CaO stream of SEG unit. Then, the design and operating variables of the conversion system are optimized for annual profit, annualized total capital cost, operating cost and exergy efficiency, using MOO. Finally, for the implementation purpose, two selection methods and parametric uncertainty analysis are performed to identify good solutions from the Pareto-optimal front."
Surfactant assisted CaO-based sorbent synthesis and their application to high-temperature CO2 capture,"Silpakorn University, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, Suranaree University of Technology, Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Chulalongkorn University",2020,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.The concern of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, a main contribution of greenhouse gases, has been emerged as an important issue for environmental impact. Adsorption of CO2 by porous solid materials is proven to be one of efficient techniques for CO2 capture technologies. In the present work, attempted has been made to improve property of porous solid materials, CaO-based sorbent, applied for high-temperature CO2 capture. CaCO3 and CaO-based alumina was synthesized using precipitation technique with the addition of sulfonic single chain (SDS) and gemini (12-carbon hydrophobic chains and 3-carbon alkyl spacer, 12-3-12) surfactants for controlling/modifying physical properties. Our studies showed that the addition of anionic surfactants affected phase formation and polymorph of CaCO3, where stronger effect was observed with gemini surfactant. The synthetic CaCO3 was derived to form CaO and applied for capturing CO2 at 600 °C, 15% v/v CO2 (N2 balanced). The results showed that CaO synthesized with adding gemini surfactant offered higher CO2 sorption capacity than single chain surfactant. By incorporating calcium with alumina using co-precipitation technique, the addition of gemini surfactant showed a good impact on CO2 capture performance as an increase in CO2 sorption capacity was observed. However, sintering effect was still not yet be resolved with the addition of gemini surfactant as CO2 sorption capacity decreased upon multiple cycles of CO2 capture."
Natural environment and circular economy? contemporary findings from ASEAN,"Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University, Mahanakorn University of Technology, Chulalongkorn University",2020,"© 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.This study examines the relationship between the natural environment and the circular economy in the ASEAN region. For better understanding, factors like carbon emission, renewable energy consumption, total natural resource rent, and plant species are selected to reflect the idea of the natural environment. For the circular economy (CE), generation of municipal waste per capita, generation of municipal waste per GDP, and generation of waste per DMC are calculated as direct measures. For the empirical investigation, panel regression models like OLS regression, fixed effect, and random effect models are applied while comparing their coefficients through Hausman and Lagrange Multiplier tests. It is found that carbon emission (factors 1), and renewable energy consumptions have shown their significant influence. Whereas, for the generation of waste (per GDP), there is significant and positive influence from TNRR and significant and negative from TNRR and NOE, under a full sample of the study. For the third indicator ofCE (generation of waste per DMC), the effect of GHGE, REC is positively significant, but through PS, the effect is positive and significant (only in OLS regression estimator). Additionally, this study has considered the first and second log difference for all three measures of CE with the causal impact from all indicators of the natural environment. This study has reasonably provided a significant and contemporary addition to the literature of the circular economy and environment for both developed and developing economies. Additionally, study findings are providing an excellent understanding for study of the relationship between environmental factors and CE in ASEAN. It is highly recommended that students in the relevant fields, academics, and researchers should use this research as documented evidence."
Transition factors to low carbon community - Engagement initiative for slum communities,Chulalongkorn University,2019,"© 2019, Econjournals. All rights reserved.Thailand has been classified as one of the ten countries that are at high risk for long-term climate change due to greenhouse gas emission, directly connected with the population size and urbanization. In 2019, Bangkok has 2,070 communities, one-third are slum communities with increasing greenhouse gas emissions. This research proposes a set of potential factors influencing community engagement initiatives to achieve a low carbon community in slum areas. The case studies on four slum communities in Bangkok by qualitative research found that the factors influencing the strength of engagement and the factors influencing the community motivation to achieve low carbon communities are still low. Consequently, this research provides new guidelines with four practical activities; (1) promoting the creation of an internal community network that can contribute to trust and positive social norms (2) promoting greenhouse gas emission reducing behaviors and adjusting attitudes toward climate change issues and (3) promoting proper relationships between the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) and the communities."
Updated basis knowledge of climate change summarized from the first part of Thailand’s second assessment report on climate change,"Environmental Research and Training Center, Mahidol University, Chulalongkorn University, Ramkhamhaeng University, Royal Irrigation Department",2023,"© 2019, Chulalongkorn University - Environmental Research Institute. All rights reserved.Recent evidence and key issues on climate change in Thailand have been presented in the first part of Thailand’s Second Assessment Report on Climate Change (2nd TRAC). The report highlights key findings including 1) a significant country-wide warming of 1.30oC over the past 48 years (1970-2017); b) significant changes in rainfall patterns at smaller spatial and finer temporal scales; c) significant changes in temperature and rainfall extreme events over the last four-five decades; d) a significant decrease in frequency of tropical cyclones entering Thailand; e) significant rise in sea level in the seas around Thailand at higher rates than the global average; and f) significant projected increases in temperature and rainfall in Thailand by 2100. The first part of the 2nd TARC provides a comprehensive and updated analysis of climate change impacts in Thailand that can be used as an authoritative reference for building understanding and awareness, as well as for designing adaptation and mitigation strategies. Moreover, it can serve as a repository for scientific information to support further research related to impact, adaptation and vulnerability to climate change. Regular assessment of national climate change impacts is essential to informing national policy and to allow policymakers to assess priorities and set meaningful targets in line with the country’s international obligations under the Climate Change Agreement."
A forecasting model for economic growth and CO2 emission based on industry 4.0 political policy under the government power: Adapting a second-order autoregressive-SEM,"Chulalongkorn University, Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University",2023,"© 2019 by the authors.This research aims to forecast future economic and environmental growth for the next 16 years (2020-2035) according to the government's strategic framework by applying the second order autoregressive-structural equation model (second order autoregressive-SEM). The model is validated by various measures, fits with the best model standards, meets all criteria of the goodness of fit, and is absent from any issues of heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity, autocorrelation, and non-normality. The proposed model is very distinct from other alternatives in that it produces the optimal outcome. Its mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 1.02% while the root mean square error (RMSE) is 1.51%. A comparison of the above results is carried out to compare the same values from other models, namely the regression linear model (ML model), back propagation neural network (BP model), artificial neural natural model (ANN model), gray model, and the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA model). The second order autoregressive-SEM is a model that is appropriate for long-term forecasting (2020-2035), and accounts for the specifics of the Thai government strategy set under the Industry 4.0 policy framework. The results of the long-term analysis indicate that the current political policy (Politi) will result in continuous economic growth, where the gross national product (GNP) growth rate will climb up to 6.45% per annum by 2035, while the environment is being negatively affected. The study predicts that CO2 emissions will rise up to 97.52 Mt CO2 Eq. (2035). The forecasting model also reflects that the economy factor has an adjustment ability to equilibrium stronger than that of the environment factor; further, it shows that the relationship between the factors is causal. In addition, the political policy (Politi), economy (Econ), and environment (Environ) factors are found to have both direct and indirect effects. As to the results, this study illustrates that the Industry 4.0 policy is still inefficient, as the carbon dioxide emissions are projected to be higher than the threshold for environment hazards and disasters which set to the limit of 80 Mt CO2 Eq. by 2035. The effect of such policy will put the environment at risk, and the government must take immediate action to respond to this urgency. Thus, the second order autoregressive-SEM model remains a significant model embedded with the adjustment ability to equilibrium and the applicability for various contexts in different sectors. This introduced model is a vital tool for assisting the national government to create policy that is effective and sustainable, and lead to positive development of the nation. This second order autoregressive-SEM model can be used as a resource for the management of both public policy and private enterprise."
Density and viscosity measurement and correlations of aqueous solution of 2-(diethylamino)ethanol for CO2 capture,Chulalongkorn University,2020,"Copyright © 2019, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.CO2 causes the global issues on climate change and global warming. The main sources of this gas are from energy consumption such as power plants and natural gas processing. The absorption technology with amine solution of 2-(Diethylamino)ethanol (DEAE) is a promising method to remove CO2 from these processes. To calculate the basic parameters such as diffusivity and the flow of fluids and to design the absorption equipment, the fundamental properties such as the density and the viscosity are needed to be measured. Therefore, the objective of this work is to measure the density and viscosity of the aqueous solution of DEAE over the entire concentration range from 0-1 mole fraction and the temperature ranging from 30-80 °C. The results present that the densities of DEAE decrease with an increase in mole fraction and temperature of solution. Also, the viscosities of all ranges of mole fraction of DEAE decrease as temperature increases. However, the viscosities increase with mole fraction of DEAE up to 0.4 and become lower. Furthermore, the correlations of the Redlich-Kister equation, the Wilson model, the Grunberg and Nissan equation and Chauhan polynomial equation have been applied to represent the results and to predict the data for the equipment design. Among them, the Redlich-Kister equation is the most suitable model to represent the results with the lowest percent average absolute deviation (%AAD) with 0.1590 % and 1.9413 % for density and viscosity."
Thailand integrated energy blueprint (TIEB): One step towards sustainable energy sector,Chulalongkorn University,2022,"© 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.In the year end of 2014, the Thailand's Ministry of Energy launched new five energy strategic plan s, named Thailand Integrated Energy Blueprint (TIEB), to catch up global dynamic factors, from economic, social, and environmental to the fluid aspects of energy industry itself. Six contexts that needs to address for forming sustainable energy sector: 1) Economy's prospect growth and investors' confidence, 2) The risk from economic uncertainty and energy price fluctuations, 3) Environmental issues and climate change, 4) Reliance on imported energy and deficit trade balance, 5) Cost of living from energy expense, and 6) Social conflict from lack of data transparency. The scenario analysis together with an energy accounting model, LEAP [1] are used in this paper. Two scenarios, Reference Scenario (REF) and Blueprint Scenario (BLU), are analyzed to illustrate the picture of Thailand's energy sector from 2014 to 2036. REF underlines a continuation of current government policies (up to 2014). Meanwhile, BLU aims at integrating all plans in TIEB to address the changing and challenging contexts Thailand will encounter in the future while keeping the balance between financial cost and benefit and the potential environmental impacts. Thailand's energy consumption is forecasted to increase 1.8 times (REF) and 1.5 times (BLU) in 2036 compared to 2013. Net Energy import will continuously increase from 2013 accounting for 48% of all primary energy demand and might reach 84% (REF) within 2036; on the other hand, Blueprint Scenario will decrease the imported energy down to only 72% in 2036 [2]."
Investigation on the increased stability of the Ni–Co bi-metallic catalysts for the carbon dioxide reforming of methane,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2020,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The carbon dioxide reforming of methane is one of the processes used to tackle global warming by reducing carbon dioxide, one of the most harmful greenhouse gases through the catalytic reaction with methane which produces syngas. Although the noble metals are good candidates for such a process, the cost and scarcity limit their uses. The non-noble metals on the other hand, with satisfactory activity and cost, are of interest except their stability against the coke formation, the main deactivation scheme during the dry reforming reaction. Therefore, the study of the enhanced stability found in the bi-metallic system of Ni catalysts via the introduction of Co was carried out in this work. The activity and coke resistance were studied on both mono and bi-metallic system of the Ni-based catalysts (10%wt) supported on γ-Al2O3-HY zeolite prepared via the sol-gel method. The activity testing was performed in a fixed-bed reactor with a unity feed volume ratio under atmospheric pressure at 973 K, where the Ni–Co bi-metallic system exhibits higher activity than both mono-metallic of either pure Ni or Co due to a higher number of active sites confirmed by the CO chemisorption. On the stability testing, the high stability was found on the bi-metallic system as verified by the time-on-stream testing. In addition, the higher reduction temperature for the bi-metallic system via the analysis using H2-TPR also suggested stronger metal-support interaction which may decrease the bonding strength of the coke on the surface leading to lower deactivation."
Mitigating bed agglomeration in a fluidized bed gasifier operating on rice straw,"Chulalongkorn University, Thailand Science Park, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2020 The AuthorsFluidized bed gasifier is a promising technology with respect to converting biomass to useful energy. Bed agglomeration is an operational challenge that arises during fluidized bed gasification with rice straw as raw materials. Rice straw contains high amounts of potassium and other components that may lower the melting point of ash, causing bed agglomeration. Using alternative bed materials such as alumina, in the place of silica, can mitigate this problem. In Thailand, rice straw is an agricultural by-product of the rice milling processes, produced in large quantities every year. Usually, rice straw management comprises open field burning, which releases greenhouse gases, particulate matter, and other pollutants. In this paper, the behaviors of bed agglomeration and defluidization were investigated during the fluidized bed gasification of rice straw, using silica and alumina as bed materials. The effect of the percentage ratio of silica and alumina (0:100; 25:75; 50:50; 75:25; 100:0) was examined. The operating parameters were as follows: rice straw particle size of 425–850μm, reaction temperature of 700–900 °C, and equivalence ratios (ER) of 0.2 and 0.4. The results showed that the percentage ratio of silica and alumina, 0:100 at 700 °C, had extended the defluidization time of 60 min. The effect of equivalence ratio on bed agglomeration was found to be apparently heightened at a high temperature. The result of SEM/EDX analysis showed that the major elements at the linkage point of the agglomerated particle were Si, K, and Ca, with regard to any proportion of the alumina bed and temperature. In conclusion, low temperature agglomerate formation can be explained by a K2O-CaO-Si2O phase diagram. The results from this investigation can be applied to biomass-fluidized bed gasification, where bed agglomeration entails a plant shutdown and is expensive in terms of maintenance."
Effect of COVID-19 virus on reducing GHG emission and increasing energy generated by renewable energy sources: A brief study in Malaysian context,"Duy Tan University, Duy Tan University, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Chulalongkorn University",2021,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has globally affected the human mortality rate and economic history of the modern world. According to the World Health Organization, COVID-19 has caused a severe threat to the health of the vulnerable groups, notably the elderly. There is still some disagreements regarding the source of the virus and its intermediate host. However, the spread of this disease has caused most countries to enforce strict curfew laws and close most industrial and recreational centres. This study aims to show the potential positive effects of COVID-19 on the environment and the increase of renewable energy generation in Malaysia. To prevent the spread of this disease, Malaysia enacted the Movement Control Order (MCO) law in March 2020. Implementation of this law led to a reduction in environmental pollution, especially air pollution, in this country. The greenhouse gases (GHG) emission, which was 8 Mt CO2 eq. from January 2020 to March 2020, reduced to <1 Mt CO2 eq. for April and May. The reduction of GHG emission and pollutant gases allowed more sunlight to reach photovoltaic panels, hence increasing the renewable energy generation."
Progress in utilisation of waste cooking oil for sustainable biodiesel and biojet fuel production,"Shanghai Jiao Tong University, University of Technology Sydney, University of Southampton Malaysia (UoSM), Trumpington Street, Markeaton Street, Chulalongkorn University, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Department of Energy Engineering",2023,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdThe increase in human consumption of plant and animal oils has led to the rise in waste cooking oil (WCO) production. Instead of disposing the used cooking oil as waste, recent technological advance has enabled the use of WCO as a sustainable feedstock for biofuels production, thereby maximising the value of biowastes via energy recovery while concomitantly solving the disposal issue. The current regulatory frameworks for WCO collection and recycling practices imposed by major WCO producing countries are reviewed, followed by the overview of the progress in biodiesel conversion techniques, along with novel methods to improve the feasibility for upscaling. The factors which influence the efficiency of the reactions such as properties of feedstock, heterogenous catalytic processes, cost effectiveness and selectivity of reaction product are discussed. Ultrasonic-assisted transesterification is found to be the least energy intensive method for producing biodiesel. The production of bio-jet fuels from WCO, while scarce, provide diversity in waste utilisation if problems such as carbon chain length, requirements of bio-jet fuel properties, extreme reaction conditions and effectiveness of selected catalyst-support system can be solved. Technoeconomic studies revealed that WCO biofuels is financially viable with benefit of mitigating carbon emissions, provided that the price gap between the produced fuel and commercial fuels, sufficient supply of WCO and variation in the oil properties are addressed. This review shows that WCO is a biowaste with high potential for advanced transportation fuel production for ground and aviation industries. The advancement in fuel production technology and relevant policies would accelerate the application of sustainable WCO biofuels."

The first global compilation of speleothem isotope records by the SISAL (Speleothem Isotope Synthesis and Analysis) working group showed that age model uncertainties are not systematically reported in the published literature, and these are only available for a limited number of records (ca. 15 %, n = 107/691). To improve the usefulness of the SISAL database, we have (i) improved the database's spatio-temporal coverage and (ii) created new chronologies using seven different approaches for age- depth modelling. We have applied these alternative chronologies to the records from the first version of the SISAL database (SISALv1) and to new records compiled since the release of SISALv1. This paper documents the necessary changes in the structure of the SISAL database to accommodate the inclusion of the new age models and their uncertainties as well as the expansion of the database to include new records and the qualitycontrol measures applied. This paper also documents the age-depth model approaches used to calculate the new chronologies. The updated version of the SISAL database (SISALv2) contains isotopic data from 691 speleothem records from 294 cave sites and new age-depth models, including age-depth temporal uncertainties for 512 speleothems."
Potential Contribution of Solar Drying Systems to Development of Rural Communities: A Case Study in Thailand農村コミュニティの発展における太陽熱乾燥システムの貢献可能性：タイにおけるケースタディ,"Yokohama National University, Chulalongkorn University",2020,"© 2020 Japan Institute of Energy. All rights reserved.The purpose of this study is to examine whether the introduction of solar drying systems contribute to the development of rural community activities in Thailand. In this study, interviews are conducted with six farmer groups who use solar drying systems for their production activities, and the empirical findings from the interviews are used as data for the analysis. The case analysis reveals that the introduction of solar drying systems has the potential to create the following three values. First, its introduction has the potential to motivate community members and bring out their initiative through the improvement of the working environment. The second is the possibility that its introduction may naturally induce learning to improve members' competence, triggered by a change in drying methods. Third, its introduction has the potential to enhance the sustainability of local communities by strengthening ties within local communities and ensuring succession. More importantly, the use of renewable solar thermal energy realizes the three values mentioned above without the consumption of fossil fuels. This study suggests that the installation of solar drying systems may not only contribute to global environmental sustainability in terms of climate change mitigation, but also to the sustainable development of rural communities in developing countries."
Designing an optimized configuration for a hybrid PV/Diesel/Battery Energy System based on metaheuristics: A case study on Gobi Desert,"Henan Agricultural University, Henan University of Technology, University of Zakho, Urmia University of Technology, University of Bonab, Chulalongkorn University",2020,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdAmong different renewable energies, the sun as an endless source of energy has been the focus of many researchers worldwide. The use of solar radiation energy in conventional power generation systems can play an important role in reducing fuel consumption and environmental pollution. The importance of this energy has been increased when we need to supply the load demand, especially in desert-like places. The main objective of this research is to propose a new optimal hybrid solar/diesel/battery system to cover the demand load of a rural part in the Gobi Desert in China. The main objectives for optimization are the loss of load probability, CO2 emissions value, and the annualized cost of the system. Here, the ε-constraint method is adopted to simplify the multi-objective problem into a single objective problem. The optimization of the problem is performed by a developed version of the elephant herd optimization algorithm and the system sensitivity analysis has been analyzed on the parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed method can provide a reliable supplement for the load demand such that the PV penetration has a prominent impact by 97.9% of the costs. The results also present that the emitted CO2 gas by the proposed cEHO algorithm by 1735 kg/year is the minimum value compared with the PSO-based optimal system and HOMER software results. The initial capital cost of the system is also achieved 48,680 $ that specifies less value than the net present cost."
"Density, viscosity, and physical CO2 diffusivity of novel formulated solvent n-methyl-4-piperidinol and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol for carbon capture","Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Mahidol University, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi",2021,"© 2020 by the authors.Amine based CO2 capture is considered as one of the most effective technologies for mitigating global warming and climate change problems. The key of this technology is to use as highly effective solvent. In the present work, novel formulated MPDL-AMP solvent has been firstly introduced. Its essential data for determining and investigating the solvent performance as an alternative solvent for capturing CO2 has not yet been reported. Therefore, density, viscosity, and physical CO2 diffusivity of novel formulated MPDL-AMP solvent were determined in this work over ranges of concentrations and temperatures of 25%wt. MPDL/5%wt. AMP to 15%wt. MPDL/15%wt. AMP and 313 K to 333 K, respectively. The physical data reported in the present work are important for determining the optimum hydrodynamics of the fluid flow inside the absorption column as well as designing the height of the column through the kinetics and the mass transfer data. The results observed in the present work showed that the novel formulated MPDL-AMP solvent should be further investigated for its potential to be used as an alternative solvent for capturing CO2."
"Mapping the natural distribution of bamboo and related carbon stocks in the tropics using google earth engine, phenological behavior, landsat 8, and sentinel-2","Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Ltd, Los Baños, Western Sydney University, Lund University, Asian Institute of Technology",2022,"© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Although vegetation phenology thresholds have been developed for a wide range of mapping applications, their use for assessing the distribution of natural bamboo and the related carbon stocks is still limited, especially in Southeast Asia. Here, we used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to collect time-series of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 images and employed a phenology-based threshold classification method (PBTC) to map the natural bamboo distribution and estimate carbon stocks in Siem Reap Province, Cambodia. We processed 337 collections of Landsat 8 OLI for phenological assessment and generated 121 phenological profiles of the average vegetation index for three vegetation land cover categories from 2015 to 2018. After determining the minimum and maximum threshold values for bamboo during the leaf-shedding phenology stage, the PBTC method was applied to produce a seasonal composite enhanced vegetation index (EVI) for Landsat collections and assess the bamboo distributions in 2015 and 2018. Bamboo distributions in 2019 were then mapped by applying the EVI phenological threshold values for 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery by accessing 442 tiles. The overall Landsat 8 OLI bamboo maps for 2015 and 2018 had user’s accuracies (UAs) of 86.6% and 87.9% and producer’s accuracies (PAs) of 95.7% and 97.8%, respectively, and a UA of 86.5% and PA of 91.7% were obtained from Sentinel-2 imagery for 2019. Accordingly, carbon stocks of natural bamboo by district in Siem Reap at the province level were estimated. Emission reductions from the protection of natural bamboo can be used to offset 6% of the carbon emissions from tourists who visit this tourism-destination province. It is concluded that a combination of GEE and PBTC and the increasing availability of remote sensing data make it possible to map the natural distribution of bamboo and carbon stocks."
"Applications of the google earth engine and phenology-based threshold classification method for mapping forest cover and carbon stock changes in Siem Reap province, Cambodia","Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Ltd., Asian Institute of Technology, Western Sydney University, Lund University",2020,"© 2020 by the authors.Digital and scalable technologies are increasingly important for rapid and large-scale assessment and monitoring of land cover change. Until recently, little research has existed on how these technologies can be specifically applied to the monitoring of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) activities. Using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform, we applied the recently developed phenology-based threshold classification method (PBTC) for detecting and mapping forest cover and carbon stock changes in Siem Reap province, Cambodia, between 1990 and 2018. The obtained PBTC maps were validated using Google Earth high resolution historical imagery and reference land cover maps by creating 3771 systematic 5 × 5 km spatial accuracy points. The overall cumulative accuracy of this study was 92.1% and its cumulative Kappa was 0.9, which are sufficiently high to apply the PBTC method to detect forest land cover change. Accordingly, we estimated the carbon stock changes over a 28-year period in accordance with the Good Practice Guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We found that 322,694 ha of forest cover was lost in Siem Reap, representing an annual deforestation rate of 1.3% between 1990 and 2018. This loss of forest cover was responsible for carbon emissions of 143,729,440 MgCO2 over the same period. If REDD+ activities are implemented during the implementation period of the Paris Climate Agreement between 2020 and 2030, about 8,256,746 MgCO2 of carbon emissions could be reduced, equivalent to about USD 6-115 million annually depending on chosen carbon prices. Our case study demonstrates that the GEE and PBTC method can be used to detect and monitor forest cover change and carbon stock changes in the tropics with high accuracy."
Mixed-integer linear program for the operational harvest scheduling problem: An application to the thai sugar industry,Chulalongkorn University,2022,"© 2020 ACM.Thai sugar industry is relatively unique due to the existence of local restrictions and practices, such as grower equity and sugarcane farm burning. All of which are interrelated and stipulated by different conflicting objectives of different key supply chain actors. In order to address these issues, a mixed-integer linear programming model for this so-called Operational Harvest Scheduling Problem (OHSP) is formulated and solved under four different aspects: (i) maximizing sugarcane input, (ii) maximizing grower profits, (iii) minimizing industrial yield loss, and (iv) minimizing environmental impact. Our preliminary computational results on 30 fictitious instances indicated that, regardless of the chosen objectives, the resulting sugarcane input did not differ much, with the maximal gap around 10% across four settings. Nonetheless, the other three objective values differed greatly and depended on the harvesting resource selection. More specifically, green sugarcane harvesting was the best in terms of both carbon emission and grower interests, while burnt sugarcane harvesting was the best in terms of extractable sugar amount. We also found that the number of harvesting resources largely affected the quality of the OHSP solutions."
Incorporating biowaste into circular bioeconomy: A critical review of current trend and scaling up feasibility,"University of Malaya, Heilongjiang Institute of Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Ltd., University of Nottingham Malaysia, Khalifa University, Chulalongkorn University, University of Science",2022,"© 2020Valorisation of biowaste is a topic of closer scrutiny for its role in transition of fossil-based economy to bioeconomy. Increasing waste generation and climate change are among the issues that can be alleviated via biowaste valorisation. Various conversion methods have been consolidated as the most effective methods to valorise biowaste into value-added products such as biofuel, biochar and other biomaterials. Recognising the need to identify areas with higher demand for scientific effort, this review aims to provide a critical overview on current trend pertaining biowaste valorisation. The rheological limitations that hinder the upscaling feasibility of biowaste valorisation are provided and discussed. Survey of academic literature to showcase the recent efforts to alleviate technical constraints is also included. With critical approach, this review is expected to highlight the setbacks and avenues in biowaste valorisation field that are useful for future research. Specifically, process optimisation and development of new products with competitive edge from biowaste are the key avenues to close the loop of circular bioeconomy."
PM10 concentration forecast using modified depth-first search and supervised learning neural network,Chulalongkorn University,2020,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) is an important factor that influences the weather and climate changes which have an impact on life and Earth. In this study, we attempt to forecast PM10 (particulate matters with diameters that are less than or equal to 10 μm) concentration by using data from Nan Province of Thailand as a case study because the main agricultural occupation of Nan is corn growing and air pollution is always the major problem in this region, especially PM10 that is the result from burning corn fields after harvesting. In order to forecast PM10 concentration at each monitoring station 1 h ahead, a novel model based on a combination of genetic algorithm, multilayer perceptron neural network, and modified depth-first search algorithm is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed model (in Fig. 6) performs better than other models when forecasting 1 h ahead."
Late Holocene hydroclimatic variation in central Asia and its response to mid-latitude Westerlies and solar irradiance,"Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tianjin University, Chulalongkorn University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Baoji University of Arts and Sciences, Zunyi Normal University, Xi'an Jiaotong University",2023,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdHydroclimatic variations in central Asia are widely recognized to be tele-connected with the North Atlantic climate via the mid-latitude Westerlies. However, the long-term hydroclimatic variation and its response to North Atlantic climate changes are not fully understood. Here we report multi-decadal and centennial hydroclimatic variations in central Asia during the late Holocene using high-resolution oxygen and carbon isotopes of bulk carbonate from a remote hydrologically closed alpine lake in Tianshan Mountains, northwestern China. The hydroclimatic variations inferred from the covariance between δ18Ocarb and δ13Ccarb and published multi-proxy in the Lake Sayram together agree well with the records from the central Asia, showing enhanced effective moisture at the intervals of 4000-3780, 3590-3210, 2800-2160, 1700-1370 and 890-280 cal yr BP during the negative phase of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Comparison with European hydroclimatic changes on centennial scale, our records not only provide valuable insight into the hydroclimatic variations in central Asia, but also indicate all broadly contemporaneous changes with that of southern Europe whereas antiphase with that of northern Europe. We then conclude that the observed antiphase hydroclimatic pattern between northern Europe and southern Europe-central Asia on centennial time scale during the late Holocene were persistently controlled by the north-south migration of mid-latitude Westerlies and changes of NAO phase in response to solar irradiance forcing. However, further research is necessary to fully disentangle the natural and anthropogenic forcing mechanisms for enhanced effect moisture and/or precipitation in central Asia."
"Partitioning growing season water balance within a forested boreal catchment using sap flux, eddy covariance, and a process-based model","Swedish University of Agricultural Science, Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke), Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Duke University, Swedish University of Agricultural Science",2022,"© 2020 Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.Although it is well known that evapotranspiration (ET) represents an important water flux at local to global scales, few studies have quantified the magnitude and relative importance of ET and its individual flux components in high-latitude forests. In this study, we combined empirical sapflux, throughfall, and eddy-covariance measurements with estimates from a process-based model to partition the water balance in a northern boreal forested catchment. This study was conducted within the Krycklan catchment, which has a rich history of hydrological measurements, thereby providing us with the unique opportunity to compare the absolute and relative magnitudes of ET and its flux components to other water balance components. During the growing season, ET represented ca. 85% of the incoming precipitation. Both empirical results and model estimates suggested that tree transpiration (T) and evaporation of intercepted water from the tree canopy (IC) represented 43% and 31% of ET, respectively, and together were equal to ca. 70%of incoming precipitation during the growing season. Understory evapotranspiration (ETu) was less important than T and IC during most of the study period, except for late autumn, when ETu was the largest ET flux component. Overall, our study highlights the importance of trees in regulating the water cycle of boreal catchments, implying that forest management impacts on stand structure as well as climate change effects on tree growth are likely to have large cascading effects on the way water moves through these forested landscapes."
Factors affecting the consumption of energy-efficient lighting products: Exploring purchase behaviors of Thai consumers,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2020 by the authors.The continued usage of inefficient lighting products in residential sectors is one of the major causes of the rapid growth in global energy consumption. Their replacement with highly efficient lighting appliances could avoid large amounts of electricity consumption and reduce CO2 emissions worldwide. In this regard, the collective contribution by the residential sector is extremely important and the increase in demand for energy-efficient lighting products can help achieve sustainability goals. This study aims to examine the determinants of household consumers' behaviors in purchasing energy-saving lighting products by applying the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as the main theoretical framework. Data (n = 288) from a survey in Thailand were analyzed using causal Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results suggested that attitude has the largest direct effect, while subjective norm was the weakest predictor of purchase intention towards light-emitting diode (LED) products. In addition, this study expands the TPB by including an investigation of a direct effect of attitude on purchase behavior. The results suggest that attitudes have a strong direct influence on the purchasing behavior for LED products. Additionally, only some socio-demographic variables have significant effects on purchase behavior. The study's findings highlight several implications for policymakers, the private sector, and green marketers in developing practical strategies. Furthermore, suggestions and future research directions are discussed."
Investigation on Solubility of Carbon Dioxide in the Mixed Aqueous Solution of MEA and 2-MAE,Chulalongkorn University,2021,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Absorption with amine solution is a method to reduce CO2 causing climate change. The commercial amine solution is MEA. The disadvantage of MEA is low CO2-loading capacity. Also, 2-(methylamino)-ethanol or 2-MAE is a new solvent developed to improve absorption performance. The aim of this work is to measure the CO2 solubility in the mixture of MEA and 2-MAE at 15:15 %wt, from 30 °C to 80 °C and CO2 partial pressures ranging from 5 to 100 kPa. From the results, at the same conditions, 30 %wt of MEA has higher absorption capacity than that of 15:15 %wt of MEA:2-MAE and 30 %wt of 2-MAE for 4.51 % and 7.04 %, respectively. For cyclic capacity, 15:15 %wt of MEA:2-MAE has capacity greater than 30 %wt of MEA for 34.10 % but lower than 30 %wt of 2-MAE for 22.78 %. A mixed-amine solution can be applied to reduce the disadvantage of MEA solution."
Measurement of Mass Transfer Coefficient of CO2-Amine System from Absorption Process,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2021,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the main factors for climate change issues. Absorption is the technology to remove CO2 from various industries. The equipment used is the packed column to promote high mass transfer rate and to study the overall mass transfer coefficient (KGav). The KGav is an important parameter for designing and scaling up of packed column. Therefore, the objective of this work is to measure KGav for CO2 absorption into the aqueous solution of monoethanolamine (MEA) in a random-packed column and to investigate effect of parameters on KGav. The parameters are the solvent flow rate from 5.3-15.9 m3/m2h, CO2 initial loading from 0.0-0.2 mole/mole and CO2 content in gas phase from 5-15 %v/v. The results show that KGav increases as the solvent flow rate and solvent concentration increase. The CO2 content in gas phase provides relatively high impact on KGav with an increase in the CO2 content."
"A new environmental performance index based on the carbon footprint, VOC emissions, and waste in a printing house",Chulalongkorn University,2022,"© 2020 The Authors. Engineering Reports published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.An environmental performance index (EPI) is introduced to evaluate the activities of a printing house based on three impacts: carbon footprint, volatile organic compound emissions, and waste. As the main causes of environmental degradation are the operation of machinery and usage of materials, we aimed to integrate the three impacts to interpret the EPI or the environmental friendliness of printing houses. Our results demonstrate that environmental awareness increased with improvements to the EPI, following the modification of printing processes and choices of printing materials. Various scenarios, including pre-press, press, and post-press, as well as printing materials, are proposed to predict trends and the possibility of increasing the EPI. Press management and materials and equipment changes have the greatest influence on the improvement of the EPI."
Long-Term Isotope Evidence on the Diet and Habitat Breadth of Pleistocene to Holocene Caprines in Thailand: Implications for the Extirpation and Conservation of Himalayan Gorals,"Chulalongkorn University, University of Tübingen, Université de Poitiers, Silpakorn University, Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Anthropology Centre, University of Tübingen",2020,"© Copyright © 2020 Suraprasit, Jaeger, Shoocongdej, Chaimanee, Wattanapituksakul and Bocherens.Three taxa within the subfamily Caprinae (Himalayan goral Naemorhedus goral, Chinese goral Naemorhedus griseus, and Sumatran serow Capricornis sumatraensis) live in the mountainous upland forests of Southeast Asia, where they are considered as vulnerable or near threatened species. Co-occurrences between these two recognized genera have been documented from some Pleistocene fossil sites in Thailand, suggesting more widely overlapping distribution in the past than today. However, diet and habitat preferences of these Pleistocene and present-day coexisting species have rarely been investigated so far. For the past three decades, stable carbon and oxygen isotope analyses become more commonplace in ecological investigations, allowing us to explore the diets and habitats of ancient and extant animals as well as to reconstruct environmental conditions in the past. We reconstructed diets and habitats of these taxa from five fossil sites in Thailand during the past 400,000 years (from the Middle Pleistocene to the Early Holocene) and from some modern wildlife using the isotopic analysis of carbonate in tooth enamel, in order to test species co-occurrence patterns during the Pleistocene and to examine possible changes of their niche breadths over evolutionary time. Our carbon isotope analysis revealed remarkably different ecological patterns between Naemorhedus and Capricornis. The Pleistocene Sumatran serow has been a greater generalist than both the Himalayan and Chinese gorals that fed on pure C4 or mixed C3 and C4 plants restricted to an open landscape habitat and than its extant population that occupies a closed-canopy forest. This suggests that the habitat contraction of the modern wildlife is likely due to the Holocene climate change and the human impacts on Thai ecosystems. In addition to the loss or reduction of grasslands after the latest Pleistocene when rainforests became dominant and besides the human hunting and predation pressure, the high interspecific competition likely contributed to the extirpation of Himalayan gorals in Thailand. Developing a strategic plan for the future biodiversity conservation, a long-term historical isotope approach allowed us to predict the contrasting habitat suitability, a lowland grassland, for these two threatened goral species as testified by their ecological persistence during the Pleistocene."
"Investigating carbon dioxide absorption by urban trees in a new park of Bangkok, Thailand","Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Kasetsart University",2020,"© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Trees remove atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, hereafter CO2 absorption (A). Despite growing urban green areas, only a few studies have quantified A of urban trees and assessed their dynamical changes with varying atmospheric conditions. Hence, we investigated A in nine dominant tree species in a new park of Bangkok. Results: Results revealed that A of two tree species (Millingtonia hortensis and Afzelia xylocarpa) significantly increased with vapor pressure deficit (VPD) until it reached a maximum and declined when VPD decreased, with no seasonal difference. Five of them (Dalbergia cochinchinensis, Tabebuia rosea, Lagerstroemia floribunda, Dipterocarpus alatus and Bauhinia purpurea) exhibited different response patterns of A to VPD between wet and dry seasons. In contrast, the A of two tree species (Samanea saman and Homalium tomentosum) did not respond to changing VPD in either season. Conclusions: Comparing planting scenarios of insensitive (i.e. no response to VPD) versus sensitive (i.e. significant response to VPD) species, we found that planting a mixture of sensitive and insensitive tree species would improve the park's capacity of A across seasons, allowing climate change adaptation to adverse environmental impacts such as droughts and the urban heat island effects, and would increase biodiversity. Additionally, planting insensitive tree species would significantly increase the capacity of the park for CO2 mitigation. These findings are useful for those who design parks and expand urban green areas to fully benefit ecosystem services from trees."
Fuel replacement: A possible option for Thailand energy security?,Institute Building III,2022,"© 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.Natural gas has been playing an important role in strengthening energy security of Thailand as over 60 percent of total natural gas consumed in the country is from the Gulf of Thailand. In the past 20 years, the average growth of natural gas demand is 5.5 percent per year. Thanks to its low carbon content, natural gas is considered as cleaner fuel comparing to other fossil-based fuels. Still, there are usages of carbon-intensive fuels such as fuel oil and coal in Thailand e.g. in the industrial sector. Most of fuel oil and coal consumed are imported from foreign countries. Replacing these fuels with natural gas may be an option for the country to promote domestic clean energy and reduce overall carbon emissions. This paper forecasts the possibility of replacing fuel oil and coal in the industrial sector with natural gas. The research starts with examining the limitations of Thai regulations, estimating the amount of natural gas required for the replacement, and forecasting future prices of all three fuels. The price projection shows an attractive option for fuel oil users as the long term price of natural gas is projected to be lower than that of fuel oil. On the contrary, the projected coal price alone will not encourage coal users to switch their fuels. Thus, strong government measures will be required to stimulate coal replacement. The result of the study will be useful for determining appropriate policies to support long-term demand for natural gas of the country."
EMBODIED CARBON EMISSIONS OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS: A CASE STUDY OF BUILDINGS IN THAILAND,"Graduate School, Chulalongkorn University, Research Unit of Environmental Management and Sustainable, Chulalongkorn University, National Science and Technology Development, Thammasat University, Chulalongkorn University, Center of Excellence on Hazardous Substance Management (HSM)",2021,"© 2020 Int. J. of GEOMATE. All Rights Reserved.With respect to moving towards development without threat to our future generations, the overwhelming unsustainable consumption of natural resources is the dominant energy and environmental concerns discussed in both international and national conferences. In particular, to find potential solutions to minimize environmental impacts, the building sector should priorly be considered since it is responsible for almost forty percent of both global energy and materials consumption and contributes around one-third of the global greenhouse gases emission. This research, therefore, aimed at evaluating the level of embodied carbon emissions derived from building construction materials, using four buildings located in an educational institute as a case study to represent the environmental performance of construction materials based on reinforce concrete structure in a tropical climate. The results revealed that on weighted average, the mass intensity and embodied carbon intensity of construction materials were 1,627 kg/m2 and 322 kgCO2/m2. In addition, the taller the building height the more likely it was to help improve such intensities. Almost 90% and 69% of the mass intensity and embodied carbon intensity derived from structural component materials whereas 24% of the embodied carbon emissions attributed to decorating component materials. The results also indicated that improvement in building with reinforce concrete structure could focus only on six materials namely concrete, steel, aluminium, cement, paint, and ceramic tile since these materials contributed 94% of embodied carbon emission. The findings will be useful for planning proactive strategies in mitigating embodied carbon in building to cope with the challenges of global warming in the future."
The potential of industrial waste: using foundry sand with fly ash and electric arc furnace slag for geopolymer brick production,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Center of Excellence on Hazardous Substance Management, Chulalongkorn University, MTEC",2021,"© 2020 The Author(s)Civil engineering; Materials science; Environmental science; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental management; Geopolymer brick; Waste foundry sand; Fly ash; Electric arc furnace slag; Leaching of heavy metals; Life cycle assessment; Economic feasibility© 2020 The Author(s)The purpose of this study was to investigate the best ratio of waste foundry sand (WFS), fly ash (FA), and electric arc furnace slag (EAF slag) for the production of geopolymer bricks. In this research study, WFS, FA, and EAF slag were mixed at the ratio of 70:30:0, 60:30:10, 50:30:20, and 40:30:30 with 8M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 98% purity sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) with a ratio of Na2SiO3/8M NaOH = 2.5. The mixtures were compacted in 5 cm × 5 cm x 5 cm molds and cured at an ambient temperature for 28 days. Then, their compressive strength was analyzed. The results showed that the geopolymer bricks with the highest compressive strength were those mixed at the 40:30:30 ratio, with a compressive strength of 25.76 MPa. The strongest bricks were also analyzed using the leaching test to ensure the production involved non-hazardous materials. To compare the environmental impacts of geopolymer bricks and concrete bricks, their effects on climate change, ozone depletion, terrestrial acidification, human toxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and fossil fuel depletion were examined from cradle to grave using SimaPro 8.0.5.13 software. The results of the life cycle assessment (LCA) from cradle to grave showed that the environmental impact of geopolymer brick production was lower in every aspect than that of concrete production. Therefore, geopolymer brick production can reduce environmental impact and can be a value-added use for industrial waste."
Building Resilience to Climate Change in Informal Settlements,"International Institute for Environment and Development and University College London Development Planning Unit, Chulalongkorn University, World Resources Institute, International Institute for Environment and Development, IIED-América Latina, University of Manchester and International Institute for Environment and Development, Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centres India and Shack/Slum Dwellers International",2022,"© 2020 The AuthorsApproximately 1 billion people currently live in informal settlements, primarily in urban areas in low- and middle-income countries. Informal settlements are defined by poor-quality houses or shacks built outside formal laws and regulations. Most informal settlements lack piped water or adequate provision for sanitation, drainage, and public services. Many are on dangerous sites because their inhabitants have a higher chance of avoiding eviction. This paper considers how to build resilience to the impacts of climate change in informal settlements. It focuses on informal settlements in cities in low- and middle-income countries and how these concentrate at-risk populations. This paper also reviews what is being done to address climate resilience in informal settlements. In particular, community- and city-government-led measures to upgrade settlements can enhance resilience to climate-change risks and serve vulnerable groups. It also discusses how the barriers to greater scale and effectiveness can be overcome, including with synergies with the Sustainable Development Goals."
"Process and sustainability analyses of the integrated biomass pyrolysis, gasification, and methanol synthesis process for methanol production","King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Chulalongkorn University",2020,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdTechnical and sustainability analyses of the methanol production via the integrated biomass pyrolysis, gasification, and methanol synthesis (IBPGM) process using rice straw as feedstock, are performed. The utilization of emitted CO2 by recycling to a gasifier as a gasifying agent is investigated for technical and environmental reasons. The effects of CO2 recirculation on the product distribution and energy consumption of the IBPGM process are examined. The production rate of methanol is improved with the increased CO2 recycle fraction, while that of bio-oil does not change. The IBPGM is a highly exothermic process, with the largest energy-releasing unit being the methanol reactor. The energy consumption at the gasifier exhibits the same trend and thermal self-sufficiency is consequently achieved when the recycle fraction is raised to 0.76. Environmental assessment using a life cycle analysis tool reveals that the energy management of methanol synthesis unit and syngas processor needs to be improved as they highly contribute toward the carbon footprint and potential environmental impact. The technical and environmental factors of the IBPGM process are evaluated by the analysis hierarchy process, calculated by a multi-criteria decision analysis method. The IBPGM process with the CO2 recycle fraction of 0.2 offers the best performance. Under this condition, the methanol and bio-oil production rates of 0.23 and 0.09 kmol h−1, respectively, and the energy efficiency of 60.7% can be achieved, based on the biomass feed rate of 1 kmol h−1."
Dynamic model and control system of carbon dioxide capture process in fluidized bed using computational fluid dynamics,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2021,"© 2019Nowadays, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has been growing continuously due to the increase of energy consumption, generated from carbon-based fuels and has created global warming. In this study, a model of carbon dioxide capture adsorption in a fluidized bed reactor was developed based on experimental data using commercial CFD program called ANSYS FLUENT. Then the model was employed to observe the hydrodynamics behavior and the dynamic responses of CO2 capture inside the adsorber when the operating variables were changed. The effects of operating variables on carbon dioxide capture were evaluated. From the simulation results, both the inlet gas velocity and the inlet solid circulation rate affected the carbon dioxide capture. The relationships between inlet gas velocity and inlet solid circulation rate to the percentage of carbon dioxide capture were investigated and analyzed by using system identification toolbox in MATLAB. After that, these relationships were used to design a control system. For the considered control system, the inlet solid circulation rate was selected to be a manipulated variable, while the inlet gas velocity, composition and temperature were designated as system disturbances. The controlled variable was carbon dioxide content remaining in the flue gas at the outlet. It was found that the control system could maintain the concentration of carbon dioxide in the flue gas at a specified value."
Development of computational fluid dynamics model for two initial CO2 concentration in circulating fluidized bed reactor,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2021,"© 2019Nowadays, the global warming is considered as a world problem because it influences the environment by increasing the average temperature of earth surface. One of the greenhouse gases that release from human activities and fossil fuels combustion in industry is CO2. Several technologies are applied to reduce the CO2 emission to atmosphere. In this study, the aim is to capture the CO2 by solid sorbent adsorption with potassium carbonate supported on gamma alumina using full loop circulating fluidized bed reactor in commercial computational fluid dynamics program, ANSYS FLUENT. This study focuses on the effect of initial CO2 concentrations from cement industry and power plant on CO2 removal efficiency. Besides, the solid volume fraction profile is also considered. The simulation results showed the hydrodynamics in circulating fluidized bed reactor that the solid sorbent was high at the reactor wall and low at the reactor center. In addition, the independent input variables were investigated which were percentage of K2CO3 loading on sorbent and gas velocity. The increasing of K2CO3 loading on sorbent and the decreasing of gas velocity increased the CO2 capture efficiency."
An LMDI decomposition analysis of carbon emissions in the Thai manufacturing sector,"King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Chulalongkorn University, Iron and Steel Institute of Thailand",2020,"© 2019During the last two decades CO2 emissions increased rapidly along with the growth of production and energy use in the industrial sector in Thailand. We use the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method to decompose the source of changes of CO2 emission level and CO2 emission intensity of the sector for the period 2005–2017. The results show that during this period, on average the amount of CO2 emissions and the CO2 emission intensity increased annually. The structural change effect helped reduce both the amount of CO2 emissions and the emission intensity. However, the increased energy intensity of individual industries led to an increase in the amount of CO2 emission and CO2 emission intensity. The study thus calls for policies to reduce energy intensity of firms in the manufacturing sectors in order for Thailand to benefit from industrial growth without having to incur greater polluting emissions."
Establishing an ocean acidification monitoring system for the tropical waters of Indonesia facing regional climate variability,"Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© The Author(s) 2020. This article is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.The emission of greenhouse gases, including high CO2 and other materials, initiates global warming and climate change. Atmospheric CO2 that affects the carbonate system of seawater causes ocean acidification (OA). OA affects marine organisms directly, as well as humans economically and ecologically. Considering the high impact of OA and following the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, systematic research and monitoring of OA is necessary in Indonesia, whose seas play an important role in this emerging phenomenon. This review discusses the urgency of OA monitoring systems and suggests carbonate system monitoring, as well as carbon biogeochemistry. OA significantly affects marine production and alters ecosystem services, and it is likely to have an impact on habitats shifting from calcified to non-calcified and reducing benthic complexity. Its effect on calcifying organisms can also be found, i.e., coral calcification and/or dissolution of CaCO3 of calcifying organisms. Acidity (pH), as well as the carbonate system variables of seawater, fluctuate, especially with variations in space and time. Coastal ecosystems that are directly affected by terrestrial input will have carbonate system variables that fluctuate more. The annual rate of decreasing seawater pH, especially over an open and large spatial scale, may indicate OA. Therefore, a monitoring system must be implemented to obtain systematic and comprehensive information on OA. Here, we also introduce a biogeochemical monitoring initiative for OA in Lombok with the established protocols. Improvement of many aspects, including analysis instruments, analysis methods, sample treatment, and sampling frequency will provide new insight into further research and monitoring of OA."
Stability analysis of vegetated residual soil slope in Thailand under rainfall conditions,"Mien Trung University of Civil Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Kasetsart University",2022,"© 2020 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.The effects of climate change including intense rainfalls have resulted in many slope failures. The bioengineering method using vegetation is an environmentally friendly alternative for slope stabilisation. This paper presents the effect of root reinforcement on the stability of vegetated slope under rainfall condition. A transient seepage and slope stability analysis was conducted based on the finite-element and limit equilibrium methods. Field monitoring on a residual soil slope in Thailand was numerically modelled. In transient seepage analysis, the soil-water characteristic curve and the saturated permeability measured from laboratory and in situ tests were used, and the results were comparable with the monitored values from the site. For slope stability analysis, the effective shear strength parameters from direct shear tests were used to model the well-compacted and non-compacted soil slopes. The additional shear strength of soil from the root cohesion was modelled for vegetated soil slope. The results show that the contribution of root cohesion to slope stability was more significant for the non-compacted soil condition than for the well-compacted one. Both modelled and monitored pore-water pressure reached the highest values about 1-d after the daily rainfall had reached its peak. This finding has a significant implication for landslide warning based on rainfall."
A forecasting model on carrying capacity for government’s controlling measure under environmental law in thailand: Adapting non-recursive autoregression based on the var-x model,Chulalongkorn University,2020,"© 2020, Econjournals. All rights reserved.This research aimed to analyze the relationship of causal factors and forecast CO2 emissions for a 15 years period from 2020 to 2034 by applying a non-recursive autoregression vector autoregression with an exogeneous model (Non-Recursive Var-X model). The Non-Recursive Var-X model has been made available for use in long-term forecasting (2020-2034), particularly in regards to the implementation of the ‘Industry 4.0’ policy of the Thai government. The study found that the results of the Thai government’s efforts or ‘governmental power’ (GP) will likely lead to levels of CO2 emissions that exceed the country’s carrying capacity as determined under its national strategic plan. The findings of this study show that CO2 emissions are expected to have a growth rate of 27.23 percent (2020-2034), reaching 95.88 Mt CO2 Eq by 2034. The Non-Recursive Var-X model provides a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.12% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.25%. In this research, the Non-Recursive Var-X model was used and CO2 emissions were forecasted to rise continuously over the established period.

Discovering the alternative construction material with the eco-friendly process and the performance similar to or greater than ordinary Portland cement has been attractive to find out. This research presented green construction materials or so-called geopolymers from metakaolin substituted by high calcium fly ash by 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 wt%. Some researches reported that geopolymer produced from metakaolin and fly ash with alkali solution gave a great result, but usually, they used fly ash containing very low calcium component. Compressive strength at 3, 7 and 28 curing days and flowability were conducted. The compressive strength of geopolymers blended with high calcium fly ash was still developed as the curing day increased and revealed the highest at 28 days especially on MK40 (high calcium fly ash 60 wt%). Geopolymer pastes prepared with a higher amount of high calcium fly ash exhibited less viscous. It was proved that the high amount of high calcium fly ash could be applied and gave extraordinary compressive strength. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence were used to investigate chemical properties as well as microstructure by a scanning electron microscope. For phase analysis, the existence of oxides of calcium and sulfur in high calcium fly ash resulted in the formation of thenardite, calcite, portlandite and C-S-H phase associating with geopolymeric phase. Therefore, this research proposed the opportunity for geopolymer production by using abundant high calcium fly ash to raise the value of the industrial waste products and green alternative construction material compared with OPC."
Annotated checklist of freshwater molluscs from the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia,"National University of Singapore, Mahidol University, Chulalongkorn University, Fisheries Admin-istration, Wonders of the Mekong Project, Khon Kaen University, University of Nevada",2022,"© Ting Hui Ng et al.The Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia is a crucial freshwater biodiversity hotspot and supports one of the world’s largest inland fisheries. Within the Tonle Sap basin, freshwater molluscs provide vital ecosystem services and are among the fauna targetted for commercial harvesting. Despite their importance, freshwater molluscs of the Tonle Sap basin remain poorly studied. The historical literature was reviewed and at least 153 species of freshwater molluscs have been previously recorded from throughout Cambodia, including 33 from the Tonle Sap basin. Surveys of the Tonle Sap Lake and surrounding watershed were also conducted and found 31 species, 15 bivalves (five families) and 16 gastropods (eight families), in the Tonle Sap basin, including three new records for Cambodia (Scaphula minuta, Novaculina siamensis, Wattebledia siamensis), the presence of globally invasive Pomacea maculata and potential pest species like Limnoperna fortunei. This study represents the most comprehensive documentation of freshwater molluscs of the Tonle Sap basin, and voucher specimens deposited at the Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute, Cambodia, represent the first known reference collection of freshwater molluscs in the country. In order to combat the combined anthropogenic pressures, including invasive species, climate change and dams along the Mekong River, a multi-pronged approach is urgently required to study the biodiversity, ecology, ecosystem functioning of freshwater molluscs and other aquatic fauna in the Tonle Sap basin."
Finding the devastating economic disaster’s root causes of the 2011 flood in thailand: Why did supply chains make the disaster worse?,"Chulalongkorn University, Public Works Research Institute (PWRI), Mahidol University, The office of Mr. Toshiyuki Adachi",2023,"© 2020, Fuji Technology Press. All rights reserved.This paper aims to identify the root causes that ex-acerbated the economic damage from the 2011 Chao Phraya river flood disaster in central Thailand industrial complex area. Finding root causes is cru-cial for learning from disasters; however, there has not been much investigation of the economic damage root causes with regard to the 2011 Chao Phraya river flood disaster. This paper seeks to investigate the root causes of the economic damage by orga-nizing the existing analytical frameworks, tools and approaches to clarify why industrial parks and estates experienced such substantial economic devasta-tion that resonated worldwide. The study’s research design includes a social background survey, in-depth interview surveys and an investigation of the disaster’s root causes. Through the research, inadequate urban and land use planning facilitated by a decentralization policy, foreign companies settlement in the coun-try, which involved urbanization and relocation with-out proper risk assessment, information, and knowl-edge, and supplier’s responsibility based on the supply chain’s structure, are detected as root causes for the high economic damage in the industrial complex area. This study also provides key lessons essential to building regional resilience in industrial complex areas: 1) considering the potential risks of regional planning, which include both socio-economic and climate changes; 2) clarifying the roles of companies, re-gions, and nations in sharing risk information with related stakeholders before, during, and after a disaster; and 3) building horizontal and vertical collaborations among all related stakeholders."
"Geopolymer bricks from concrete residue and palm oil fuel ash: Evaluating physical-mechanical properties, life cycle assessment and economic feasibility",Chulalongkorn University,2020,"© 2020, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment. All rights reserved.This study investigated the development of physical and chemical properties in geopolymer brick from palm oil fuel ash by adding concrete residue. Palm oil fuel ash was mixed with concrete residue in five ratios: 100:0, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30 and 60:40 by weight. Ten molar alkaline activator solution was prepared from NaOH and Na2SiO3 in the weight ratio of 2:5. The physical and mechanical properties of the bricks were analyzed according to Thai standard TIS 77-2545, and the chemical properties were investigated for brick structure. Life cycle assessment (LCA) using SimaPro 7.3.3 and economical feasibility were calculated. The results showed that calcium oxide in concrete residue reduced the pore volume and increased the formation of calcium silicate hydrate gel and developed the compressive strength. Using 40% concrete residue in geopolymer brick produced the highest compressive strength (12.53 MPa). Geopolymer bricks made from palm oil fuel ash and concrete residue with the optimal ratio 60:40 had low impact on climate change, at 18.49%. The break even volume was 577,428 pieces, and the payback period was 3.88 years."
A study on correlations between computer-aided instructions integrated environmental education and students' learning outcome and environmental literacy,"Krirk University, Chulalongkorn University, Huaqiao University",2021,"© 2020 by the authors.Environmental actions without protection desire and skills would be vain. The task of education is to create such thirst and motive under the encouragement of the community. For this reason, it is expected to open students' future green new horizons of environmental awareness with teaching methods and research tools which could enhance students' environmental literacy, when largely promoting the low-carbon and energy-saving sustainable life. In this case, it is necessary to deeply understand students' environmental awareness and teach them with strict curriculum mapping and design to reinforce students' environmental competence so as to cope with currently extreme climate change. Aiming at students of Tungfang Design University, Taiwan, total 221 students, as the experimental objects, are preceded computer-aided instruction integrated environmental education. The experimental teaching is preceded 3 hours per week for 15 weeks (total 45 hours). The research results show positive relations between 1. environmental education and learning outcome, 2. learning outcome and environmental literacy, and 3. environmental education and environmental literacy. Suggestions are proposed according to the results, expecting to assist domestic students in enhancing self-development through the awareness of the responsibility for environmental issues.

Efficient use of energy resources on Malaysian farms,"Srinakharinwirot University, Chulalongkorn University, Suan Dusit University",2023,"© 2020, Econjournals. All rights reserved.The purpose of this study is to discover an approach where the outputs of the farms are maximum at the minimal input. Malaysia is well known for its crop (such as rubber, rice, palm oil, tea). Prior studies show that due to the climate change, there are likely chances that the farms of Malaysia will go extinct. In this study, the main focus is to efficiently use the energy resources to save it for the future in a prolonged manner. The data was collected from the website of Department of Statistics Malaysia, Official Portal. The data was taken for rubber and crops category. In order to run the analysis, the non-parametric approach was used, which is also knows as data envelopment analysis. It is used to explore the efficient use of energy resources. The findings suggest that rubber farms are the most technical efficient as compared to other farms. Further, the results show that there are many factors that counts and sums up the efficiency of the farm. Whilst studying the technical efficiency, this study finds that the soil and climate conditions contributes to the efficiency and productivity of the farms."
"Energy consumption, economic growth and environmental degradation in 4 asian countries: Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand","Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University, North Bangkok University, Chulalongkorn University",2021,"© 2020, Econjournals. All rights reserved.This paper examines dynamic causal relationships between pollutant emissions, energy consumption and output for a panel of 4 Asian (MMVT) countries over the period 1971-2005, except for Vietnam (1990-2005). In long-run equilibrium energy consumption has a positive and statistically significant impact on CO2 emissions. In the short term, changes in emissions are driven mostly by the error correction term and short term energy consumption shocks, as opposed to short term output shocks for each country. Short-term deviations from the long term equilibrium take from 0.77 years (Myanmar) to 4.84 years (Malaysia) to correct. The panel causality results indicate there are energy consumption–emissions bidirectional strong causality and energy consumption–output bidirectional long-run causality, along with unidirectional both strong and short-run causalities from emissions and energy consumption, respectively, to output. Overall, in order to reduce CO2 emissions and not to adversely affect economic growth, increasing energy supply investment and energy efficiency, and stepping up energy conservation policies to reduce unnecessary wastage of energy can be initiated for energy-dependent MMVT countries."
"The supply chain integration, and product modularity as antecedents of the market valuation of firms in Thai solar industry","Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2020 ExcelingTech Pub, UK.The main purpose of the current study is to examine the supply chain integration, and product modularity as antecedents of the market valuation. The study is carried out on the supply chain of the solar industry of Thailand. The reason why the solar industry is chosen is that the greater emphasis on rising oil prices, global regulatory environment, and climate change resulted in increased adoption of clean technology processes. Over the next few decades, the solar energy would be considered as an important technology stemming from fast-paced innovation and huge technological investment. Being an infant industry, the solar energy supply chain is evolving rapidly with the entrance of new as well as already established firms. The study has used the SEM-PLS to analyses the data gathered from the firms in the solar industry. The findings of the study argue that the aggregated product modularity affects the supply chain flexibility and supply chain's ability of delivering product variety, across the supply chain. Such aggregated product modularity, being an important SC construct, shows the product modularity of supply chain as a whole."
Decomposition analysis of the carbon emissions of the manufacturing and industrial sector in Thailand,"King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi, Chulalongkorn University, Iron and Steel Institute of Thailand",2020,"© 2020 by the authors.Since the 1990s, CO2 emissions have increased steadily in line with the growth of production and the use of energy in the manufacturing sector in Thailand. The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index Method is used for analysing the sources of changes in CO2 emissions as well as the CO2 emission intensity of the sector in 2000–2018. On average throughout the period, both the amount of CO2 emissions and the CO2 emission intensity increased each year relative to the baseline. The structural change effect (effect of changes of manufacturing production composition) reduced, but the intensity effect (effect of changes of CO2 emissions of individual industries) increased the amount of CO2 emissions and the CO2 emission intensity. The unfavourable CO2 emission intensity change came from the increased energy intensity of individual industries. The increased use of coal and electricity raised the CO2 emissions, whereas the insignificant change in emission factors showed little impact. Therefore, the study calls for policies that decrease the energy intensity of each industry by limiting the use of coal and reducing the electricity used by the manufacturing sector so that Thailand can make a positive contribution to the international community’s effort to achieve the goal of CO2 emissions reduction."
Reducing Heat Duty of MEA Regeneration Using a Sulfonic Acid-Functionalized Mesoporous MCM-41 Catalyst,"Hunan University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyAmine-based CO2 capture is a promising method to limit global CO2 emissions. However, large thermal energy consumption for CO2 desorption during amine regeneration has limited large-scale worldwide applications. Here, we show that an efficient MCM-41-SO3H-0.6 catalyst presented a superior catalytic performance, decreasing the relative heat duty by one-third and enhancing the instantaneous desorption rate by up to 195% in comparison with the monoethanolamine (MEA) regeneration without catalysts. The excellent catalytic activity is related to the combination of the properties of mesopore surface area × total acid sites, and a possible catalytic mechanism is proposed for the MCM-41-SO3H catalysts. Furthermore, the experimental results in the MEA solution regeneration process were consistent with density functional theory calculations in revealing the catalytic desorption mechanism. This work demonstrated that MCM-41 functionalized with sulfonic acid group catalysts could play an essential role in the post-combustion CO2 capture technology using aqueous MEA for industrial applications."
Tropical Pacific Forcing of Hydroclimate in the Source Area of the Yellow River,"Yunnan University, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Technological University, Qinghai Normal University, Chulalongkorn University, The University of Queensland",2023,"© 2021. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.The source area of the Yellow River (SAYR) contributes over one third of the basin discharge and bears disproportionate significance to water conservation in China. Hydroclimate changes in the SAYR, therefore, have potential far-reaching socioeconomic consequences. However, the major drivers of the SAYR hydroclimate remain poorly understood, largely due to limited hydroclimatic records. Here, we analyzed the organic, carbonate contents and stable isotopes of 14C-dated sediments from Ngoring Lake to reconstruct regional hydroclimate spanning the last ∼2,000 years. The results suggest that the SAYR experienced a near-millennium-long drying trend since the Medieval Warm Period, regardless of temperature changes and meltwater inputs. This trend, coherent with hydroclimate records from north China, is likely forced by a reduction in tropical Pacific zonal sea surface temperature gradient. Furthermore, our records have significant implications for other parts of the Tibetan Plateau that will likely develop similar hydroclimate conditions to the SAYR in the future."
"Evaluation of regulating and provisioning services provided by a park designed to be resilient to climate change in bangkok, Thailand","Kasetsart University, National Research University—Kasetsart University, Chulalongkorn University, Kasetsart University, Kasetsart University, Maejo University",2022,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Understanding the ecosystem services provided by urban green spaces, in terms of their environmental, economic, and social benefits, is essential for a better management of area. Chulalongkorn University Centenary Park (CU 100) was established to mitigate the effects of climate change, especially flood prevention. This study focused on quantifying the ecosystem services provided by the trees in the park in terms of regulating and provisioning services. A publicly available tool, the i-Tree Eco international software, was used with data obtained from a local weather station as proxies to determine the accuracy of the analysis. Services, quantified in terms of monetary value, included avoided runoff, carbon storage, carbon sequestration, pollution removal, and timber price. The total monetary benefits, obtained from 697 trees (56 species, 49 genera, and 22 families), were estimated at USD 101,400. Of the total services, provisioning services contributed 75% to the total monetary value. Among all regulating services, the avoided runoff contributed about 60%, which was considered as the goal achieved by the park design. Azadirachta indica A. Juss (USD 518.75/tree−1/year−1), Shorea roxburghii G. Don (USD 417.17/tree−1/year−1) and Millettia leucantha Kurz (USD 414.87/tree−1/year−1) provided the greatest benefit, as indicated by a high value of provisioning services in terms of a high timber quality. These results can be used when planning the composition of trees to be planted in urban areas to increase both green spaces and maximize ecosystem services to improve the vitality of human well-being."
Growth-climate relationships and long-term growth trends of the tropical forest tree choerospondias axillaris (Anacardiaceous) in east-central Thailand,"Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Mahidol University, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Western Australia, University of Maine, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Kasetsart University, National Science and Technology Development Agency, Mahidol University",2022,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Tropical forests play important roles in global carbon cycling. Tree-ring analysis can provide important information for understanding long-term trends in carbon-fixation capacity under climate change. However, tree-ring studies in tropical regions are limited. We carried out a tree-ring analysis to investigate the dendrochronological potential of the tropical forest tree Choerospondias axillaris (Anacardiaceae) in east-central Thailand. Our study focused on growth-climate relationships and long-term growth trends. A chronology was constructed covering the period from 1932 to 2019. The tree-ring width index of C. axillaris was positively correlated with precipitation in June, July, and October. Furthermore, growth of C. axillaris was positively correlated with the Standard-ized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) from July to October, indicating that growth of C. axillaris is mainly limited by moisture availability in the late monsoon season. Moving correlation analysis further revealed the consistency and temporal stability of the relationship of tree growth with monsoon season precipitation and SPEI during the period under study. There was a significant increasing trend in long-term growth from 1932 to 2002 (slope = 0.017, p < 0.001); however, long-term growth decreased from 2003 to 2019 (slope = −0.014, p < 0.001). Our study provides important insight into the growth-climate correlations of a broad-leaved tree species in a dry evergreen forest in tropical Asia."
A new cluster of rhabdovirus detected in field-caught sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) collected from southern Thailand,"Walailak University, Walailak University, Walailak University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2021, The Author(s).Background: The distribution of phlebotomine sand flies is changing rapidly due to climate change. This issue has implications for the epidemiology of sand fly-borne diseases, especially sand fly-associated viruses. Few studies concerning sand fly-associated viruses have been conducted in Thailand. Therefore, this study aimed to perform a molecular survey of groups of pathogenic RNA viruses belonging to the Orbivirus, Phlebovirus, and Flavivirus genera and family Rhabdoviridae in sand fly samples collected from southern Thailand. Methods: Sand flies were collected at two locations in Trang and Songkhla provinces of southern Thailand, and individual sand fly samples were processed for species identification and virus detection. The Orbivirus, Phlebovirus, and Flavivirus genera and family Rhabdoviridae molecular determination was performed by RT-PCR, and positive samples were identified by cloning and sequencing, cell culture inoculation, and phylogenetic analysis. Results: The results presented in this study were based on the analysis of a total of 331 female sand flies. This molecular study revealed evidence of Rhabdoviridae family virus presence in Phlebotomus papatasi (3/331, 0.9%). The findings demonstrated a new cluster of rhabdovirus that was closely related to Bactrocera dorsalis sigmavirus strain BDSV.abc5 and the lineages of insect-specific Rhabdoviridae. In addition, the Bayesian tree suggested that the common ancestor of this group was the dimarhabdovirus clade. It was assumed that the virus may have switched hosts during its evolution. However, the detection of Orbivirus, Phlebovirus, and Flavivirus genera using specific primers for RT-PCR was negative in the collected sand flies. Conclusions: There is limited knowledge on the genetic diversity and ecology of Rhabdoviridae in Thailand. This is the first data regarding the circulation of Rhabdoviridae in Ph. papatasi from Thailand. We found a new cluster of rhabdoviruses that was close to the new B. dorsalis sigmavirus. It is possible that there is a great deal of diversity in this family yet to be discovered, and a more extensive survey for new rhabdoviruses may uncover viruses from a wide diversity of host taxa and broaden our understanding of the relationships among the Rhabdoviridae.

Assessment and analysis of multi-biomass fuels for sustainable electricity generation,"Chulalongkorn University, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Burapha University, Chulalongkorn University",2021,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdMany biomass power plants are not flexible, using only one fuel type, and have high CO2 emissions. In this study, a new methodology to assess the multi-biomass utilization for a power plant is proposed. The results provide that the proportions of mixed biomass residues in different regions of Thailand are appropriate with lower chloride content and slagging inclination than the standard specification. However, high alkali metal oxides in biomass in the southern region lead to high fouling inclination with high fly ash deposition. The electricity production using multi-biomass fuel is more efficient with lower fuel consumption than that with single-type biomass. To generate 103.43 MW electricity production, 107.89 t h−1 consumption of mixed biomass fuels in the central is lower than that with multi-biomass in other regions. However, it generates a maximum of 12.5 mol% CO2 in exhaust gases which can be captured by suitable amine-based absorbents with 90.82% efficiency."
Adaptability of siamese rosewood and teak seedlings to varying light conditions,"Kasetsart University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2021, Faculty of Environment and Resource Studies,Mahidol University. All rights reserved.Rosewood and Teak are valuable timber species, which have been heavily logged from both natural forests and plantations. Climate change has also contributed to a reduction in their numbers. We studied their light adaptability at the seedling stage to quantify the growth and physiological characteristics under 10% and 100% of full sunlight. Rosewood performed better, as indicated by the relative growth rate, chlorophyll content, and chlorophyll efficiency, under both shade and sunlight. We also simulated a sudden change in light intensity (gap opening up in the canopy) by exposing seedlings, previously under shade, to full sunlight. Rosewood seedlings responded faster (higher relative growth rate) to changing light conditions relative to Teak. We conclude that Rosewood seedlings can be planted either under shade, or in full sunlight, or in a location experiencing sudden change from shade to sunlight, while Teak seedlings should be planted under at least 10% sunlight, but not in full sunlight, as it can lead to chlorophyll and tissue damage."
Different responses of soil respiration to environmental factors across forest stages in a Southeast Asian forest,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Kasetsart University, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research UFZ, Chulalongkorn University, National Science and Technology Development Agency, Mahidol University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2021,"© 2021 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Soil respiration (SR) in forests contributes significant carbon dioxide emissions from terrestrial ecosystems and is highly sensitive to environmental changes, including soil temperature, soil moisture, microbial community, surface litter, and vegetation type. Indeed, a small change in SR may have large impacts on the global carbon balance, further influencing feedbacks to climate change. Thus, detailed characterization of SR responses to changes in environmental conditions is needed to accurately estimate carbon dioxide emissions from forest ecosystems. However, data for such analyses are still limited, especially in tropical forests of Southeast Asia where various stages of forest succession exist due to previous land-use changes. In this study, we measured SR and some environmental factors including soil temperature (ST), soil moisture (SM), and organic matter content (OM) in three successional tropical forests in both wet and dry periods. We also analyzed the relationships between SR and these environmental variables. Results showed that SR was higher in the wet period and in older forests. Although no response of SR to ST was found in younger forest stages, SR of the old-growth forest significantly responded to ST, plausibly due to the nonuniform forest structure, including gaps, that resulted in a wide range of ST. Across forest stages, SM was the limiting factor for SR in the wet period, whereas SR significantly varied with OM in the dry period. Overall, our results indicated that the responses of SR to environmental factors varied temporally and across forest succession. Nevertheless, these findings are still preliminary and call for detailed investigations on SR and its variations with environmental factors in Southeast Asian tropical forests where patches of successional stages dominate."
Microalgae and ammonia: A review on inter-relationship,"University of Nottingham Malaysia, Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, Chulalongkorn University, Khalifa University of Science and Technology, University of Seoul, Saveetha University",2022,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdWith increasing threat of global warming to the livelihood of planet earth, reduction of carbon emission to the atmosphere is inevitable. Carbon emission reduction can be achieved through carbon capture and replacement technologies. Microalgae and ammonia (NH3) have been known to be carbon capture and carbon replacement option, respectively. This paper examines the inter-relationship between these two candidates with carbon reduction potential: microalgae and ammonia, and their future perspectives. Firstly, impact of ammonia presence in natural habitat of microalgae is identified, from the aspect of microalgal growth characteristic, photosynthetic performance, and biochemical composition. Possible solutions of ammonia removal in aquatic system include biotreatment with microalgae, nitrification–denitrification with bacteria, ion exchange using zeolites, and membrane contactor technologies. Next, with ammonia being identified as potential future energy source, conventional ammonia production, as well as bio-ammonia production are discussed. Microalgae technology used to produce syngas through pyrolysis and hydrothermal gasification (HTG) are reviewed and is identified to produce ammonia to achieve carbon emission reduction target. Finally, the challenges and impacts of bio-ammonia production using microalgae are highlighted. The main factors determining the sustainability of microalgae-based technology are energy demand, environmental impacts, and production cost, with each having challenges to varied extent. Governmental policies that drive the development in this field are also discussed. However, further research on the impact on environment and energy consumption need to be thoroughly carried out, to enable clear improvement over current usage of fossil fuel."
CeO2/CuO/TiO2heterojunction photocatalysts for conversion of CO2to ethanol,"King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.An attempt to reduce CO2 emissions has led to the development of CeO2/CuO/TiO2 heterojunction photocatalysts for photoconversion of CO2 to useful products, e.g. ethanol. Composite photocatalysts were simply prepared by mixing TiO2 (P25) with different mass ratios of CeO2 (1 wt%) and CuO (2 or 3 wt%) by ball milling. The prepared photocatalysts had uniformly distributed CeO2 and CuO phases, throughout the TiO2 phase. The integration of CeO2 and CuO into TiO2 at 1 wt% CeO2 and 3 wt% CuO produced a composite, with a reduced band gap of 2.88 eV, allowing absorption of lower energy light and a lower electron-hole recombination rate. The 1%CeO2/3%CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts yielded ethanol at 30.5 μmol gcat-1 h-1, almost three times higher than the yield from pure TiO2. This improved CO2 conversion efficiency was due to contributions from properties of both additives: CeO2 increased light absorption, while CuO acted as an electron trap and enhanced CO2 adsorption. In addition, the heterojunction at the interfaces facilitated the photogenerated charge separation, which, in turn, increased the charge participation in the catalyzed conversion reactions."
"Factors affecting technology selection, techno-economic and environmental sustainability assessment of a novel zero-waste system for food waste and wastewater management","Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdTo provide food waste energy recovery, sludge management and building wastewater recycling with the primary goal of achieving zero-waste discharge, a novel integrated single-stage anaerobic co-digestion and moving bed biofilm reaction membrane bioreactor system has been developed. The acceptability of the technology and the sustainability of the zero-waste system were assessed by a proposed stepwise evaluation approach that included the factors affecting its usage, technical performance, environmental sustainability and economic feasibility. Based on the three experimental cases of the system prototype, the anaerobic co-digestions of food waste and wastewater sludge (Cases 2 and 3) provided slightly higher methane generation rates than was achieved from the mono-digestion of food waste (Case 1). Average methane yields from the anaerobic co-digestion (Cases 2 and 3) were in the range of 0.352–0.353 L/g TVS. The ratios of VFA/Alk of all the experimental cases were lower than 0.25, indicating the stable anerobic co-digestion performances. The MBBR-MBR was able to achieve ammonia removal rate in the range of 0.34–0.77 g NH4/m2-day. The co-treatment of combined wastewater was able to provide good reclaimed water that was suitable for landscape use. Life cycle assessment results showed that the proposed zero-waste system could reduce the impacts of climate change, eutrophication, acidification, and fossil resource depletion compared to conventional waste treatment. The economic Internal Rate of Return, Net Present Value, and Benefit/Cost of the system were around 9%, 2222 USD, and 1.44, respectively. The challenges and opportunities from implementing the system were discussed."
Generation expansion planning with energy storage systems considering renewable energy generation profiles and full‐year hourly power balance constraints,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2021,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This paper proposes a methodology to develop generation expansion plans considering energy storage systems (ESSs), individual generation unit characteristics, and full‐year hourly power balance constraints. Generation expansion planning (GEP) is a complex optimization problem. To get a realistic plan with the lowest cost, acceptable system reliability, and satisfactory CO2 emissions for the coming decades, a complex multi‐period mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model needs to be formulated and solved with individual unit characteristics along with hourly power balance constraints. This problem requires huge computational effort since there are thousands of possible scenarios with millions of variables in a single calculation. However, in this paper, instead of finding the globally optimal solutions of such MILPs directly, a simplification process is proposed, breaking it down into multiple LP subproblems, which are easier to solve. In each subproblem, constraints relating to renewable energy generation profiles, charge‐discharge patterns of ESSs, and system reliability can be included. The proposed process is tested against Thailand’s power development plan. The obtained solution is almost identical to that of the actual plan, but with less computational effort. The impacts of uncertainties as well as ESSs on GEP, e.g., system reliability, electricity cost, and CO2 emission, are also discussed."
"Citywide energy-related co2 emissions and sustainability assessment of the development of low-carbon policy in chiang mai, thailand","Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Cities are one of the key contributors to the environment and sustainability. This study aims to quantify citywide energy-related CO2 emissions and assess the sustainability feasibility of implementing climate change mitigation policies in Chiang Mai, Thailand. By employing the GPC method, it was found that the average energy-related CO2 emission in Chiang Mai from 2015 to 2019 was 2,146,060 tCO2eq. Residences, industries (i.e., food preservation industries), and commercial and governmental buildings were the top three energy consumption-related GHG emitters. According to the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), in terms of mitigation measures, LED lighting presented the highest score (0.380), followed by improving air conditioning efficiency (0.278), and the use of energy-efficient appliances (0.203). Energy-efficient technologies would be more feasible than the development of renewable energy technologies to lower CO2 emissions. In terms of sustainability, political, technical, and economic feasibility criteria presented the highest AHP score (0.789), followed by human and social dimensions criteria (0.129), and environmental performance criteria (0.073). Policy possibility had the highest AHP score, while direct contribution to climate benefits as GHG reduction presented the lowest score. The integration of climate mitigation opportunities into national policies, the green industry scheme, and promoting residents’ self-determined motivation are urgently recommended."
Regulatory stringency and behavior in a common pool resource game: Lab and field experiments,Chulalongkorn University,2021,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Reducing deforestation is one of the key actions necessary to mitigate global climate change.

This paper applies a common pool resource game to look at whether or not changing the level of permitted resource use (i.e. regulatory stringency) affects behavior in a low-enforcement environment. The experiments are conducted in both the lab and the field in Thailand. We study the impact of varying the rule on permitted resource use on resource extraction, individual payoff and payoff distribution. Three levels of resource use are studied – strict, moderate, and relaxed, corresponding to disallowing usage, allowing a moderate amount of use, and allowing a generous amount of use respectively. We find that in our settings, imposing a strict rule is not always the best strategy to manage a common pool resource. In fact, allowing a higher level of resource use yields more desirable social (more equitable payoffs distribution), economic (individual payoff), and environmental (remaining resource stock) outcomes. Thus, our findings suggest that in a low enforcement environment, the design of the rule itself could help motivate conservation behavior by allowing resource users to realize the economic benefits of conservation."
Towards high carbon conversion efficiency by using a tailored electrodialysis process for in-situ carboxylic acids recovery,"Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hunan Agricultural University, RMIT University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdProduction of carboxylic acids from anaerobic fermentation has gained increasing attention. However, acidogenic fermentation is still facing challenges such as low yield of carboxylic acids and difficulties in product recovery and purification. The emission of acidogenic off-gas CO2 leads to a reduced carbon recovery (∼70%) and also increases the carbon footprint of the anaerobic treatment process. In this study, a tailored electrodialysis stack was integrated with a fermenter to recover the products and hence to improve quantity and quality of the produced carboxylic acids. Three levels of currents, i.e., 0.4, 1, and 4 A (T1, T2, and T3), were applied during electrodialytic separation of carboxylic acids and 12 cycles of electrodialysis were carried out to evaluate the performance of the integrated system. Results showed that different degrees of carboxylic acids removal led to varied impacts on the yield of carboxylic acids, economic viability, and the instability of microbial community. Compared with the case without coupling electrodialysis process, the carbon conversion rate increased by 28.04% in T3, which was due to the reuse of inorganic carbon introduced by a tailored electrodialysis process. After 12 cycles of fermentation, the percentage of Clostridiales finally increased from 0.11% (inoculum) to 31.15% in T3, which also confirmed the possible autotrophic acidogenesis by using inorganic carbon. This work would provide a promising solution to improve the recovery of carboxylic acids from organic wastes and achieve minimum carbon footprint in the organic waste management process."
Examining the impact and influencing channels of carbon emission trading pilot markets in china,Chulalongkorn University,2023,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.As China has an important role in global climate change, the Chinese government has set goals to improve its environmental efficiency and performance and launched carbon emission trading pilot markets in 2013, aiming to reduce CO2 emissions. Based on panel data of 30 provinces from 2005 to 2017, this paper uses the difference‐in‐difference method to study the impact of China’s carbon emission trading pilot markets on carbon emissions and regional green development. The paper also explores possible influencing channels. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) China’s carbon emission trading policy has promoted a reduction in CO2 emissions and carbon emission intensity and has increased green development in the pilot areas. (2) The main path for China’s carbon emission trading policy to achieve carbon emission reduction and regional green development is to promote technology adoption. (3) China’s carbon emission trading policy achieves green development through synergistic SO2 emission reduction. The pilot carbon markets have reduced both the amount of SO2 emissions and SO2 emission intensity."
"A review on the performance, combustion, and emission characteristics of spark-ignition engine fueled with 2,5-dimethylfuran compared to ethanol and gasoline","Ho Chi Minh City University of Transport, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HUTECH), Phenikaa University, Diponegoro University, Chulalongkorn University, Ho Chi Minh City University of Transport",2023,"Copyright © 2020 by ASME.Currently, the supply of diminishing fossil fuel reserves, and the rise in challenges in environmental, political and economic consequences have caused the great concerns in the development of modern society; these have forced the policy-makers and researchers to look for the renewable and green energy sources. Deemed as a promising renewable alternative to traditional fossil fuels, 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF, chemical formula C6H8O)-a derivative of furan-has the potential to relieve the growing shortage of fossil fuels while satisfying the increase in global energy demand and minimizing the adverse effects of climate change. DMF can be used as a clean source of liquid transportation biofuel given the fact that it is directly obtained from biomass-derived carbohydrates. In reviewing current DMF production methods, this review paper analyzes and presents the comparison of catalytic performance in the conversion of biomass into DMF. In addition, the applicability of DMF in spark-ignition (SI) engines is thoroughly analyzed based on the spray and flame, combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of SI engines running on DMF compared with ethanol and gasoline. More interestingly, the knocking, lubrication, and wear characteristics in SI engines fueled with DMF are also evaluated and discussed. Nonetheless, further investigation on optimization strategies on DMF production process should be conducted prior to the initiation of large-scale commercialization as well as the application of DMF to real-world SI engines."
"Projection of hydro-climatic extreme events under climate change in yom and nan river basins, thailand","King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Chulalongkorn University",2021,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Due to a continuous increase in global temperature, the climate has been changing without sign of alleviation. An increase in the air temperature has caused changes in the hydrologic cycle, which have been followed by several emergencies of natural extreme events around the world. Thailand is one of the countries that has incurred a huge loss in assets and lives from the extreme flood and drought events, especially in the northern part. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the hydrological regime in the Yom and Nan River basins, affected by climate change as well as the possibility of extreme floods and droughts. The hydrological processes of the study areas were generated via the physically-based hydrological model, namely the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The projected climate conditions were dependent on the outputs of the Global Climate Models (GCMs) as the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6 and 8.5 between 2021 and 2095. Results show that the average air temperature, annual rainfall, and annual runoff will be significantly increased in the intermediate future (2046–2070) onwards, especially under RCP 8.5. According to the Flow Duration Curve and return period of peak discharge, there are fluctuating trends in the occurrence of extreme floods and drought events under RCP 2.6 from the future (2021–2045) to the far future (2071–2095). However, under RCP 8.5, the extreme flood and drought events seem to be more severe. The probability of extreme flood remains constant from the reference period to the near future, then rises dramatically in the intermediate and the far future. The intensity of extreme droughts will be increased in the near future and decreased in the intermediate future due to high annual rainfall, then tending to have an upward trend in the far future."

This review revealed that algae was the pre-dominant CO2 sequester than terrestrial plants in an eco-friendly and economical way with simultaneous wastewater remediation. Hydrothermal liquefaction of algae biomass was the most preferred mode for biofuel generation than pyrolysis due to high moisture content. The algae based fuels exhibit less greenhouse gases emission and higher energy value. This review helps the researchers, environmentalists and industrialists to evaluate the impact of algae based bio-energy towards green energy and environment."
Multiple drivers of hydrological alteration in the transboundary Srepok River Basin of the Lower Mekong Region,"Asian Institute of Technology, Asian Institute of Technology, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdHuman-induced changes in land and water resources adversely affect global hydrological regimes. Hydrological alteration of the natural flow regime is considered to have a significant damaging and widespread impact on river ecosystems and livelihoods. Therefore, understanding the hydrological alteration of rivers and the potential driving factors affecting such alterations are crucial to effective water resources management. This study analyses the impact of changes in land use, climate, and hydropower development on the hydrological regime of the Srepok River Basin in the Lower Mekong Region. The Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) in Southeast Asia is known for its agriculture, forests, fisheries, wildlife, and diverse natural ecosystems. Historical land use and climate change are quantified (utilising European Space Agency land cover and observed meteorological data) and correlated with the hydrological indicators using the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) software. Moreover, pre and post impacts on the hydrological regime by hydropower development are quantified using the Range of Variability Approach (RAV) in IHA software. The results reveal that land use, rainfall, and temperature affect different aspects of the hydrological regime, with corroborating evidence to support variation among the most correlated IHA and environmental flow component (EFC) parameters with the three drivers. The highest and lowest correlations among the IHA and EFC parameters under each driver are against land use (0.85, −0.83), rainfall (0.78, −0.54), and minimum and max temperatures (0.42, −0.47). Among the parameters, the fall rate has the most significant effect on hydrological alteration of all drivers. Hydropower development in the basin mostly affects the fall rate and reversal. Identifying the connection between these multiple drivers and hydrological alteration could help decision-makers to design more efficient and sustainable water management policies."
Migration and sustainable development in Thailand,Chulalongkorn University,2023,"© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: Previous studies have focused on migration and development from an economic perspective. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate sustainable migration and development in an integrative manner, including economic, social and environmental perspectives linking theoretical frameworks with empirical evidence in Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: A framework of migration and sustainable development was developed in a structured and integrative manner, and the shift in migration and development patterns in Thailand was examined from an empirical and theoretical standpoint. Findings: Migration contributes to Thailand’s economy in many ways. Migrant workers help to grow the economy, especially in labor-intensive sectors. This helps reduced income inequalities at the household level through remittances. Climate change will enhance migration, especially from neighboring countries and within Thailand itself, thus helping to reduce poverty and income inequality. Possible economic gains from migration, as well as circulating workers and international retirement migrants are highlighted. Research limitations/implications: Only studies published in English or Thai were included, which may have resulted in the omission of some research. A need for rethinking policy design and implementation as a source of sustainable development is required. Originality/value: Despite the recent influences of political and environmental changes, there has previously been no analysis of migration and sustainable development in Thailand in a structured and integrative manner as in this study. The impact of migration on the diffusion of new technology and brain drain issues was also addressed."
Climate change risk assessment and adaptation for loss and damage of urban transportation infrastructure in Southeast Asia,"Southern Institute of Water Resources Research (SIWRR), Chulalongkorn University, Sub-Institute of HydroMeteorology and Climate Change (SIHYMECC), Transport Development and Strategy Institute, Royal University of Phnom Penh, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Ltd, Dalat University",2023,"© The authors.Climate change (CC) will potentially have negative consequences for urban transportation infrastructure (UTI). It is important to improve our understanding of CC-associated loss and damage in relation to UTI. However, there is limited knowledge on how to practically assess loss and damage for UTI in the context of CC, and future-proof transportation planning. This study presents the results and experiences from the assessment of CC-related loss and damage to UTI in six cities of Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam. It was found that the selected cities were highly vulnerable to CC given their location, exposure to sea level rise, storm surge, flooding, and salinity intrusion. Through analyses conducted using NK-GIAS software, economic losses for different flood scenarios were determined. The linkage between flooding and road damage was demonstrated, with maximum damage estimations under the most extreme flooding scenario of approximately 20 million USD for Hoi An, 3 million USD for Kampot and 21 million USD for Samut Sakhon, corresponding to water levels of 3.94 m, 4.7 m and 2.7 m respectively. Road damage was identified as a key impact related to CC. Further research is recommended to develop damage curves, addressing both flood depth and duration, to strengthen the NK-GIAS analyses."
"EVALUATION of SATELLITE IMAGERY DATA for CROP YIELD SIMULATION in SARABURI PROVINCE, THAILAND","Kasetsart University, Yamaguchi University, Chulalongkorn University, Kasetsart University",2022,"© ACRS 2021.All right reserved.Climate change could be a severe cause of disaster as well as food shortage. As the climate, society, and the environment change, these could bring more difficulties for agricultural planning because of unexpected decreasing yields of food crops; this could create a poverty situation. Therefore, an appropriate crop yield estimation methodology should be developed to help individual farmers plant crops. It is not only for adequate and safe food crops but also sustainable agricultural planning. A crop yield model is a technology that could be the best tool for farmers and researchers to develop yield products and farm management. Many crop-model studies have applied low-resolution data over a large area, and therefore the yield calculation of a whole district or village has resulted in the exact figure, whereas in reality, many paddy areas have a fragmented pattern with small rice plots.This study emphasized transplanted rice in a tiny area in Saraburi province. Field survey experiments have been conducted at observing rice characteristics to calibrate the crop parameters for local rice varieties. The cultivar-specific and agricultural practices were measured and evaluated. Integration of moderate-resolution satellite image and the AquaCrop model was performed to extract the essential crop parameters of paddy for yield simulation using the model. The green canopy cover (CC) information derived from the satellite data has provided acceptable results through the rice yield simulation and observed yield validation."
Economic and environmental assessment of bio-hydrogenated diesel production process from waste cooking oil integrated with reforming process,"King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, Prince of Songkla University, Chulalongkorn University",2021,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.This work focuses on the performance analysis and life cycle assessment of two BHD production processes from waste cooking oil coupled with a reformer. The first process produces hydrogen from gas flare from the oil and gas industry, while the second process produces hydrogen from by-product propane. It was revealed that the second process requires less hydrogen by 15.27%, compared to the first process. However, its heating and cooling utilities were 22% and 10% higher than the first process. The economic assessment showed that the first process has a net present value of 2.39 times higher than the second one. Life cycle assessment is evaluated in terms of carbon footprint and other environmental impacts by using LCSoft program. It was found that the carbon footprint released by the second process was higher than the first process by 0.45 kgCO2 eq. The second process was also found to have higher environmental impacts in most categories. Thus, it can be concluded that the first process is preferable."
Potassium carbonate supported on γ -alumina sorbent regeneration in fluidized bed reactor for carbon dioxide capture technology,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2021, Chulalongkorn University, Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts. All rights reserved.Nowadays, the world is facing severe climate change due to the rapid increase in the world population and the continuing growth of the economy and industry. These lead to substantial greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide, which causes global warming. Thus, carbon dioxide (CO2) capture becomes an essential technology for mitigating adverse effects on the atmosphere. The solid sorbent is an appropriate alternative for CO2 capture because it is cheap, environmentally benign, and recyclable. In this study, solid-sorbent regeneration using potassium carbonate supported on gamma-alumina in a fluidized bed reactor was investigated. The effects of operating variables of solid sorbent regeneration were studied by varying the temperatures of 100, 200, and 300 degrees Celsius and pressures in the range from 0 to 1 atmospheric pressure. The results showed that regeneration temperature had a positive effect and initial pressure had a negative effect on the sorbent regeneration, respectively. The sorbent regeneration can be enhanced by increasing the regeneration temperature and decreasing the initial pressure. The optimal condition for sorbent regeneration was at the temperature of 300 degrees Celsius and initial pressures of 0.35 bar. Kinetic studies of the sorbent regeneration were also conducted, and obtained a pseudo-second-order model to be the best-fit model."

The total emission of greenhouse gases is called the carbon footprint and is expressed in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) units. As a new educational institution, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) began to take part in an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) programme that supports the reduction in carbon emissions. In this study, the total amount of CO2 produced from UTM during 4 years was measured under three categories: (1) the emissions from the fleet of university vehicles for public transportation, (2) the electricity and water emissions, and (3) the emissions produced by staff and student transportation, waste generation, paper, and maintenance by contractors. The special evaluation method is an alternative method to calculate greenhouse gases and measures all elements/sources of greenhouse gases under the same functional unit. This reference helps the assessor to avoid the double measurement of anthropogenic gases. The study results demonstrated that air transportation utilised by university students and employees and electricity usage contributed to 34.74%, 19.37%, and 18.19% of the carbon emissions, respectively. The total CO2 emissions from the three sources over 4 years were 48.442 MT. The data on the carbon footprint of the university can form the basis for monitoring, evaluation, and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in Malaysia. Moreover, the university constructed and operates a smart house, a large solar parking lot with a capacity of 10 MW, uses solar and wind-powered lighting, and encourages the use of bicycles and electric scooters to achieve an annual reduction in the total CO2 emissions intensity. The results of this study suggested that a carbon reduction project could encourage university members and public society to an understanding of the environment and allowing UTM to become a centre of excellence for the operation of a green campus for urban areas.

However, peatland ecosystems are still omitted from the main Earth system models that are used for future climate change projections, and they are not considered in integrated assessment models that are used in impact and mitigation studies. By using evidence synthesized from the literature and an expert elicitation, we define and quantify the leading drivers of change that have impacted peatland carbon stocks during the Holocene and predict their effect during this century and in the far future. We also identify uncertainties and knowledge gaps in the scientific community and provide insight towards better integration of peatlands into modelling frameworks. Given the importance of the contribution by peatlands to the global carbon cycle, this study shows that peatland science is a critical research area and that we still have a long way to go to fully understand the peatland–carbon–climate nexus."
Designing a Built-In Electric Field for Efficient Energy Electrocatalysis,"Central South University, Central South University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2022 Authors. All rights reserved.To utilize intermittent renewable energy as well as achieve the goals of peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality, various electrocatalytic devices have been developed. However, the electrocatalytic reactions, e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction/oxygen evolution reaction in overall water splitting, polysulfide conversion in lithium-sulfur batteries, formation/decomposition of lithium peroxide in lithium-oxygen batteries, and nitrate reduction reaction to degrade sewage, suffer from sluggish kinetics caused by multielectron transfer processes. Owing to the merits of accelerated charge transport, optimized adsorption/desorption of intermediates, raised conductivity, regulation of the reaction microenvironment, as well as ease to combine with geometric characteristics, the built-in electric field (BIEF) is expected to overcome the above problems. Here, we give a Review about the very recent progress of BIEF for efficient energy electrocatalysis. First, the construction strategies and the characterization methods (qualitative and quantitative analysis) of BIEF are summarized. Then, the up-To-date overviews of BIEF engineering in electrocatalysis, with attention on the electron structure optimization and reaction microenvironment modulation, are analyzed and discussed in detail. In the end, the challenges and perspectives of BIEF engineering are proposed. This Review gives a deep understanding on the design of electrocatalysts with BIEF for next-generation energy storage and electrocatalytic devices."
The contribution of a catchment-scale advice network to successful agricultural drought adaptation in Northern Thailand,"Cranfield University, Chiang Mai University, Chulalongkorn University, King Mongkut's University of Technology",2022,"© 2022 The Author(s).The intensification of drought affects agricultural production, leading to economic losses, environmental degradation and social impacts. To move toward more resilient system configurations requires understanding the processes that shape farmers' adaptation amidst complex institutional contexts. Social networks are an important part of collective action for supporting adaptive capacity and there are continuing calls to strengthen network connectivity for agricultural governance under the impacts of climate change. Through a survey of 176 farmers in northern Thailand, we explore the extent to which the characteristics of information shared in a catchment advice network are associated with adaptations. Statistical analyses reveal the perceived efficacy of communications as well as farmers' relative closeness in the advice network to be positively associated with adaptation to drought. We identify a capacity for local actors to bridge information bottlenecks in the network and opportunities for institutions to enhance their dissemination of information to reach less networked farmers. We find that not all adaptations are perceived as effective against future drought and infer opportunities to support engagement with extension services, encourage the sharing of local knowledge and experience and devise policy and interventions to strengthen advice networks for more resilient agricultural systems.

It is not yet clear whether and how these complex and more simple forms of cooperation relate. Prior work has found that countries with individuals who made more socially mindful choices were linked to a higher country environmental performance – a proxy for complex cooperation. Here we replicated this initial finding in 41 samples around the world, demonstrating the robustness of the association between social mindfulness and environmental performance, and substantially built on it to show this relationship extended to a wide range of complex cooperative indices, tied closely to many current societal issues. We found that greater social mindfulness expressed by an individual was related to living in countries with more social capital, more community participation and reduced prejudice towards immigrants. Our findings speak to the symbiotic relationship between simple and more complex forms of cooperation in societies."

Benthic microalgae, in contrast to the phytoplankton that is able to be transported by currents, have limited dispersal ability and thus are a better ecological indicator to climate changes. Here we performed sampling in the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea and South China Sea and established twenty-six strains of benthic Prorocentrum for detailed morphological and molecular examinations. Five Prorocentrum species, including P. concavum, P. fukuyoi, P. mexicanum, P. tsawwassenense, and P. cf. sculptile, were identified. Both P. concavum and P. fukuyoi displayed marked intraspecific divergences in large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA gene sequences, corresponding to their geographical origins. In contrast, P. mexicanum strains shared identical LSU sequence. Prorocentrum tsawwassenense and P. cf. sculptile are not suitable ecological indicators as they were rarely observed. Prorocentrum mexicanum is not recommended either as it is present across the region. In contrast, P. concavum and P. fukuyoi have advantages as ecological indicators for climate changes in the Western Pacific as they comprise several ribotypes with differentiated biogeography. Toxin analysis was also performed on all five species except P. fukuyoi by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, but okadaic acid was not detectable."
Engineered living photosynthetic biocomposites for intensified biological carbon capture,"Newcastle University, Northumbria University, Newcastle University, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2022, The Author(s).Carbon capture and storage is required to meet Paris Agreement targets. Photosynthesis is nature’s carbon capture technology. Drawing inspiration from lichen, we engineered 3D photosynthetic cyanobacterial biocomposites (i.e., lichen mimics) using acrylic latex polymers applied to loofah sponge. Biocomposites had CO2 uptake rates of 1.57 ± 0.08 g CO2 g−1biomass d−1. Uptake rates were based on the dry biomass at the start of the trial and incorporate the CO2 used to grow new biomass as well as that contained in storage compounds such as carbohydrates. These uptake rates represent 14–20-fold improvements over suspension controls, potentially scaling to capture 570 tCO2 t−1biomass yr−1, with an equivalent land consumption of 5.5–8.17 × 106 ha, delivering annualized CO2 removal of 8–12 GtCO2, compared with 0.4–1.2 × 109 ha for forestry-based bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. The biocomposites remained functional for 12 weeks without additional nutrient or water supplementation, whereupon experiments were terminated. Engineered and optimized cyanobacteria biocomposites have potential for sustainable scalable deployment as part of humanity’s multifaceted technological stand against climate change, offering enhanced CO2 removal with low water, nutrient, and land use penalties."
Specific heat capacity prediction of hybrid nanofluid using artificial neural network and its heat transfer application,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2022 The Author(s)Currently, many industries aim to improve the heat transfer system to reduce cost and carbon emission. For improving heat exchanger apparatus, the convectional working fluid such as water can be replaced by hybrid nanofluid. The hybrid nanofluid is a suspension of nanoparticles into conventional base fluids to improve its properties. Generally, different combinations of nanoparticle and base fluid can variably enhance the specific heat capacity for removing heat from the system. In this study, the artificial neural network was thus employed to develop the prediction model for predicting specific heat capacity using feedforward and cascade forward propagation networks with Levenberg–Marquardt learning algorithm. The best artificial neural network (ANN) model topology was selected to predict specific heat capacity of hybrid nanofluid with R value of 0.9919, 0.9473 and 0.9673 for training, validating and testing, respectively. Then, the specific heat capacity value from ANN model was applied to evaluate and analyze the heat transfer rates. The hybrid nanofluid with Al2O3 and CuO in water exhibited the best heat removing medium in heat exchanger application."
Community engagement initiative amid climate change crisis: Empirical evidence from a survey across Bangkok Metropolis of Thailand,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdAccording to the Paris Agreement on climate change regulations and Sustainable Development Goal 13, Low Carbon City, a community-based action, shall be widely used to encourage the transformation of cities by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from daily life. However, the concept of Low Carbon City requires community engagement from inhabitants, but building community engagement remains a considerable challenge, especially in low- to middle-income countries worldwide. Bangkok is one of the megacities vulnerable to climate change. This study focuses on analyzing the factors affecting the community engagement initiative to transform Bangkok into a low-carbon city. The study used a quantitative research technique with a sample size of 2000. The results reveal that 11 factors influence the success of the community engagement initiative in the transition to a low-carbon city. These critical factors include the salience on climate change, experience with climate change threats, significance of climate change, response of government officers to climate change, negative or positive emotion toward climate change, trust in the community and the municipal administration, and community affiliation, solidarity, and participation. Additionally, based on the stepwise multiple regression, statistical models were proposed to explain how the critical factors affecting community engagement transform Bangkok into a low-carbon city."
"City-wide greenhouse gas emissions of communities nearby the world heritage site of Ayutthaya, Thailand","Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2022, The Author(s).Climate change has emerged one of the greatest threats to sustainable development. Cities are a major contributor to high carbon dioxide levels. This research aimed to quantify city-wide GHG emissions and investigate the potential for climate change mitigation in communities near the World Heritage Site (WHS) of Ayutthaya, Thailand via the multi-criteria analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The total city-wide GHG emission of Ayutthaya Municipality in 2018 was 99,137.04 tCO2eq (1.93 tCO2eq per capita). Energy and waste sectors were the two largest emitters. Pratuchai, the most populated subdistrict and the WHS location, was the largest source of GHGs. However, the cultural heritage site emitted only 0.2% of total GHGs. Based on the IPCC2013 LCA method, residential sector accounted for the largest share (74%), while the WHS contributed only < 1% of total energy-related CO2 emissions. If all the Thailand’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) Roadmap are fully implemented in the residential sector, total GHGs would be reduced by 9735.47% tCO2eq and 6846.86 tCO2eq in 2030.

Portable solar-powered dual storage integrated system: A versatile solution for emergency,"Suankularb Wittayalai School, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Ritsumeikan University, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2022 International Solar Energy SocietyIncreasing climate change-caused natural disasters calls for mobile self-powered backup solutions for rescue and survival. However, existing portable solar systems rely on single storage with high risk of suspension in emergency and prolonged cloudy period. This work presents a portable solar-dual storage system, which enables essential loads to function continuously regardless of weather. The system operates with a supercapacitor to buffer fluctuating solar power in the Direct mode, a battery-supercapacitor integration to enable extended low light load usage in the Off-grid mode, and a developed mode selector controller for overall energy management. Optimum size of the supercapacitor was determined to buffer the load and quickly recharge within the average low light period of 5–12 min. The simulated solar irradiance from 400-1000 W/m2 was utilized to verify automatic selection between two independent modes: direct and off-grid. Furthermore, outdoor behavior of the system has been investigated on a representative sunny, cloudy, and mixed day. Moreover, different combinations of DC and AC loads including an 80 W notebook with a power larger than the solar panel (20 W) have been demonstrated to function steadily for a few hours outdoor. This system's signatures include manual mode selection possibility by users and automatic switching ability to a direct mode for when the battery is completely discharged or malfunction for continuous operation of the loads. This portable solar-powered system can be used in variety of scenarios and provides clean solar energy to essential electrical appliances for lighting, communication etc., thus increasing the chance of survival during emergency."
Gendered vulnerability and inequality: understanding drivers of climate-smart agriculture dis-and nonadoption among smallholder farmers in Malawi and Zambia,"North-West University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2022, Resilience Alliance. All rights reserved.In this study we explore gender-differentiated drivers of disadoption and nonadoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) technologies among smallholder farmers for everyday adaptation and resilience building in the face of the increasing threat of climate risk. We apply theoretical perspectives from mainstream technology adoption and gendered vulnerability to identify underlying vulnerabilities and inequalities that drive disadoption (the decision to discontinue any CSA technology previously practiced) and nonadoption (the decision not to use any form of CSA technology). We used an exploratory-sequential mixed methods design at the local level in Chikwawa, Malawi, and Gwembe, Zambia, to understand gender-differentiated drivers of CSA disadoption and nonadoption. Key interviews were conducted with identified critical informants at the district level, followed by focus group discussions with men and women at the village level to obtain qualitative data. We collected quantitative data through a cross-sectional household survey. Findings show that gender-differentiated drivers of CSA disadoption and nonadoption fall within social, economic, institutional, and environmental categories and underlying gendered vulnerability and inequality shape these drivers. CSA is introduced within preexisting gendered vulnerability and inequality, shaping adoption decisions by diverse groups of female and male smallholder farmers. Consequently, CSA outcomes of improved agricultural productivity, adaptation, and resilience building may not be equally achieved because of gender inequalities and vulnerabilities that demotivate diverse households from adopting CSA. This work contributes to a contemporary gender-transformative paradigm in climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction by focusing on CSA adoption in climate-sensitive regions."
Hierarchical Porous Carbon Fibers Synthesized by Solution-Plasma-Generated Soot Deposition and Their CO2 Adsorption Capacity,"Nagoya University, Nagoya University, Strategic International Collaborative Research Program (SICORP), Research Institute and Academia (OPERA), Shinshu University",2022,"© 2022 by the authors.Global warming caused by CO2 emissions is a major environmental problem. Thus, the development of materials with innovative architectures that approach the CO2 problem is a necessity. In this study, hierarchical porous carbon fibers (HCFs) were synthesized by a chemical deposition process that operates at 400 °C and uses solution-plasma-generated soot (PGS) as a carbon precursor. Subsequently, the CO2 adsorption capacity of the synthesized material was evaluated. The HCFs showed enhanced surface areas and networks of micropores and mesopores. Moreover, the HCFs were post treated by metal etching and KOH activation. The post treated HCFs achieved a CO2 uptake of 0.8 mmol g−1 at 273 K, which was superior to the simultaneously produced solution plasma carbon (SPC), which has a CO2 uptake of 0.2 mmol g−1."
"Assessment of Climate Change Impacts on the Water, Food, and Energy Sectors in Sittaung River Basin, Myanmar","Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, Asian Institute of Technology",2023,"© 2022 by the authors.The Sittaung river basin (SRB) remains one of the least studied basins of Myanmar in terms of the assessment of the impact of climate change. As several reservoirs already exist in the basin, much research is needed to understand how projected climate change impacts rainfall, temperature, flows, domestic and agricultural demands, and hydropower generation. Given the limitation in observed data on the ground, a combination of satellite-derived meteorological data and digital elevation data is used to generate inputs to a Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model. Five CMIP5 GCMs are used in the WEAP to assess the impact of climate change on the water, food, and energy production of the SRB for the baseline (BL: 1985–2014), near future (NF: 2021–2050), and far future (FF: 2051–2080) periods. The results indicate that the average temperature and rainfall are likely to increase in the future for the SRB. December and January are expected to be drier and warmer, whereas rainy months are expected to be wetter and warmer in the future. The BL flows (1091 m3/s) are expected to increase by 7–10% during NF and by 16–19% during FF at the basin outlet. Meanwhile, the unmet domestic demand during BL (1.3 MCM) is expected to decrease further by approximately 50% in the future. However, the unmet agricultural demand (667 MCM) for food production is estimated to increase from the BL by 11–15% during NF and by 14–19% during FF. Similarly, the total energy generation of nine hydropower projects (4.12 million MWh) is expected to increase by 9–11% during NF and by 16–17% during FF. Thus, the riverine flows are expected to increase in the future, thus positively impacting the domestic and hydropower sectors, whereas the unmet demands in the agricultural sector likely remain unsatisfied. These results will help the water, agriculture, and energy sectors to develop strategies to maximize benefits and cope with the impacts of climate change in the near and long-term future."
Current challenges of biomass refinery and prospects of emerging technologies for sustainable bioproducts and bioeconomy,"University of the Punjab, Chulalongkorn University, Quaid-e-Azam Campus, Huaiyin Institute of Technology",2023,"© 2022 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The depletion of fossil resources and the resulting global warming are the primary motivators for moving from a fossil-based to a biobased economy. Biorefineries, like petro-based refineries, offer a green and sustainable option for producing marketable biobased goods through decarbonization pathways, hence upgrading the bioeconomy. In the context of the industrial revolution, economic and environmental sustainability are critical in adopting biorefinery systems. However, biorefineries still face numerous hurdles. There are numerous technological, economic, ecological, sociological and long-term issues throughout the biorefinery production chain. The key difficulties facing biorefineries today are acceptance in the present market of the ‘fossil-based economy’, the composition and availability of feedstock, the quantities needed to meet the market demand, the efficiency of the resource recovery, techno-economic viability and sustainability. Life cycle assessment may provide a thorough input on the environmental setting during process optimization, minimizing the biorefinery project's environmental impact. In this review, we outline the bottlenecks and obstacles that biorefineries face while producing biofuels from biomass, as well as how biotechnology and modern technology might help researchers to overcome them. Biorefineries need to optimize their biomass usage to generate products that properly fit the market expectations. These items should be cost-effective when compared with fossil fuels. Currently, 85–90% of petroleum refinery output is used to make fuels, with only 10–15% going to the petrochemical industry to make organic compounds. To precisely match market demands, the biorefinery should produce the same proportion of fuels and organic compounds. To overcome the challenges, biofermentation, membrane technologies and oxidation processes, among other developing technologies, are drawing interest in several areas of biorefinery. Biorefinery systems necessitate a systematic process for identifying impacts and assessing their long-term viability. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Board gender diversity and environmental emissions,"Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Chulalongkorn University, The University of Western Australia, Pennsylvania State University",2022,"© 2022 The Authors. Business Strategy and The Environment published by ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.The recent climate emergency declaration by many nations around the world signifies the severity of the impact of climate change. As an entity which consumes a large quantity of resources ranging from material to human, corporations have a responsibility to seriously tackle climate change. As a company's board of directors is typically responsible for developing business strategies, including environmental strategies, this paper explores whether gender diversity on corporate boards affect firms' emission performance. Consistent with diversity theory, we find that board gender diversity is positively associated with firms' emission reduction performance. The likelihood that a firm with a gender diverse board reduces environmental emission is 9% higher than its industry peers. To ensure that our results are robust to endogeneity, we conduct additional analyses including propensity score matching (PSM), entropy balancing, and instrumental-variable analysis."
Coastal Erosion and Flood Coping Mechanisms in Southern Thailand: A Qualitative Study,"Thammasat University, Chulalongkorn University, UNAIDS Regional Support Team for Asia and the Pacific, Chulalongkorn University, Mahidol University, Mahidol University, Mahidol University, Edge Hill University",2023,"© 2022 by the authors.Communities in coastal regions are affected by the impacts of extreme climatic events causing flooding and erosion. Reducing the impacts of flood and erosion in these areas by adopting coping strategies that fortify the resilience of individuals and their localities is desirable. This study used summative content analysis to explore the coping mechanisms of coastal communities before, during, and after various dangers relating to flooding and erosion. The findings from the study show that effective surveillance systems, disaster preparedness, risk mapping, early warning systems, availability of databases and functional command systems, as well as reliable funding are essential to efficiently cope with hazards of coastal flooding and erosion. As flooding and erosion have been predicted to be more severe due to climate change in the coming years, the adoption of effective natural and artificial mechanisms with modern technologies could help coastal regions to be more resilient in coping with the dangers associated with flooding and erosion. Pragmatic policies and programs to this end by actors are critical to averting crises induced by flooding and erosion in coastal areas."
Chula model for sustainable municipal solid waste management in university canteens,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, National Science and Technology Development Agency",2022,"© 2022 The Author(s)Managing the large amount and variety of waste produced by university canteens is challenging. This study used life cycle assessment (LCA) to investigate sustainable municipal solid waste (MSW) management solutions for Chulalongkorn University (CU) canteens. This study assessed three scenarios for MSW management in CU canteens: the past scenario (prior to the Chula Zero Waste Project in 2016; S1); the current scenario (2017–2021, when the Chula Zero Waste Project's MSW management system was used; S2); and the future scenario (after 2021 with the new MSW management option for CU canteens under Chula Zero Waste; S3). The obtained results were characterized by eight impact categories: climate change, ozone depletion, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, human toxicity, photochemical oxidant formation, particulate matter formation, and fossil depletion. The LCA results show that the future scenario (S3) under the Chula Zero Waste Project is sustainable for MSW management. The most environmentally sustainable MSW plan for CU canteens is to reduce, separate it at the source, and reuse materials instead of landfilling mixed waste."
Current strategies and future perspectives in biological hydrogen production: A review,"Chulalongkorn University, Uppsala University, University of Otago, Royal Society of Thailand",2023,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdBiohydrogen is a green and eco-friendly energy carrier with the potential to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels. Renewable biohydrogen production from waste biomass sources is potentially cheap; however, large-scale commercial production has not yet been achieved. Problems that need to be tackled include identifying industrially competent microorganisms, and appropriate bioreactor designs enabling novel hybrid methods such as integration of dark fermentation with electro-fermentation and utilization of microbial organisms doped with semiconducting nanomaterials for enhanced production. This review focuses on the production of hydrogen by biological methods, highlighting various fermentation processes, the role of enzymes, and different pretreatment methods. The waste materials used are briefly summarized, and current strategies in biological hydrogen production, including biomimetic and synthetic biology approaches, are assessed for their economic feasibility and their potential to contribute to net zero carbon emission. The lignocellulosic waste and the dynamic membrane bioreactor are the best suitable biomass and bioreactor, respectively for biohydrogen production. The integrated method of dark fermentation and electro-fermentation yields 41% higher hydrogen compared with dark fermentation alone. Finally, this review points out that significant efforts focusing on the development of hybrid fermentation technologies along with the development of novel engineered strains are needed for the commercial-scale production of biohydrogen in the future."
Life cycle environmental impact assessment of cyanate removal in mine tailings wastewater by nano-TiO2/FeCl3 photocatalysis,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMitigating the environmental health impact associated with cyanate is one of the key challenges facing local communities and the mining industry. Cyanate and cyanide are often found as co-contaminants in the environment. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research on the life cycle assessment (LCA) of photocatalytic cyanate degradation. This study aims to assess the environmental impacts of cyanate degradation by nano-TiO2/FeCl3 photocatalysis and compare the life cycle impacts of UV-A-, visible-, and solar-driven photocatalysis. The functional unit of the LCA involves “the degradation of 98% cyanate from 1 L wastewater by nano-TiO2/FeCl3.” In the synthesis of TiO2 photocatalysts, the IMPACT 2002+ LCA method reveals that aquatic ecotoxicity, non-renewable energy, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and global warming are the main contributors to total environmental damage through cyanate removal by nano-TiO2/FeCl3 photocatalysis. Ethanol and electricity consumption generates higher environmental impacts than other inputs. The results of endpoint analysis highlight that climate change associated with electricity contributes the greatest environmental impact across the entire photocatalysis life cycle for cyanate removal under all different irradiation sources. This study provides deeper insight into the life cycle environmental hotspots of photocatalytic cyanate degradation by nano-TiO2, potentially enabling mining operators and stakeholders to achieve resource efficiency and cleaner production."
Microalgae-based wastewater treatment for developing economic and environmental sustainability: Current status and future prospects,"Chulalongkorn University, Panyapiwat Institute of Management Demonstration School",2023,"Copyright © 2022 Srimongkol, Sangtanoo, Songserm, Watsuntorn and Karnchanatat.Over the last several decades, concerns about climate change and pollution due to human activity has gained widespread attention. Microalgae have been proposed as a suitable biological platform to reduce carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, while also creating commercial sources of high-value compounds such as medicines, cosmetics, food, feed, and biofuel. Industrialization of microalgae culture and valorization is still limited by significant challenges in scaling up the production processes due to economic constraints and productivity capacities. Therefore, a boost in resource usage efficiency is required. This enhancement not only lowers manufacturing costs but also enhancing the long-term viability of microalgae-based products. Using wastewater as a nutrient source is a great way to reduce manufacturing costs. Furthermore, water scarcity is one of the most important global challenges. In recent decades, industrialization, globalization, and population growth have all impacted freshwater resources. Moreover, high amounts of organic and inorganic toxins in the water due to the disposal of waste into rivers can have severe impacts on human and animal health. Microalgae cultures are a sustainable solution to tertiary and quaternary treatments since they have the ability to digest complex contaminants. This review presents biorefineries based on microalgae from all angles, including the potential for environmental pollution remediation as well as applications for bioenergy and value-added biomolecule production. An overview of current information about microalgae-based technology and a discussion of the associated hazards and opportunities for the bioeconomy are highlighted."
"A preliminary assessment of geological CO2 storage in the Khorat Plateau, Thailand","Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"Copyright © 2022 Chenrai, Jitmahantakul, Bissen and Assawincharoenkij.The main carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Thailand come from the energy sector. Gas-based power plants, including natural gas and biogas, are CO2 point sources, and are mostly located in the Khorat Plateau. Geological CO2 storage is an important element in the effort to reduce CO2 emissions from CO2 point sources. This study is a preliminary assessment of the geological CO2 storage potential of the onshore Khorat Plateau. A potential geological formation is screened and ranked in terms of its suitability as a CO2 storage site (storage optimization, risk minimization and feasibility). The results of this screening and ranking indicate that, among the tested sites in this study, the Khorat Permian carbonate is the most suitable for geological CO2 storage, followed by the Khorat Group sandstone, and Khorat evaporite. However, the Khorat Cenozoic basalts are not suitable for geological CO2 storage in the Khorat Plateau. The results from this study should advance the understanding of petroleum exploration and carbon capture and storage technology in Thailand, especially in the Khorat area. However, it should be noted that more subsurface studies are needed, and more criteria should be included in the future to improve the reliability of the assessment of geological CO2 storage potential in the Khorat Plateau."
Emergy investigation of carbon dioxide utilization processes for methanol synthesis,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.CO2 to methanol (C2M) technology has been a promising sustainable solution with negative carbon emissions. A suitable indicator is needed to ensure that it demonstrates the progress in moving toward a zero-net emission. This study proposed an emergy analysis of three alternative methanol productions from captured CO2. These are methanol from direct hydrogenation with hydrogen from natural gas reforming (Case 1), methanol from direct hydrogenation with hydrogen from water electrolysis (Case 2), and methanol from CO2/NG/steam-mixed reforming (Case 3). The highest emergy consumption per joule methanol (with a transformity of 2.93 ×105 sej/J) was Case 2. According to emergy distribution, the emergy input that dominates each case study includes; natural gas (as raw material and fuels) in Case 1 and Case 3 and electricity for water electrolysis in Case 2. When comparing transformity with conventional methanol production from fossil fuel, the CO2 to methanol processes could compete with the traditional one. Moreover, with the implementation of renewable electrical sources (wind power), the transformity of Case 2 could be reduced to 4.95 × 104 sej/J and became lower than the methanol production from biomass (7.87 ×104 sej/J). This improvement leads Case 2 to be the preferable choice for methanol production."
Porous carbon derived from Surfactant/Polybenzoxazine Blends,"Kasetsart University, Chulalongkorn University, Khon Kaen University",2023,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Carbon dioxide adsorption based on porous materials has emerged as a promising technique to prevent the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere and to capture GHGs before they enter the carbon cycle. In this work, polybenzoxazine (PBZ) was synthesized and carbonized at 1173 K for use as a CO2 capture material and a catalytic support for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. The effect of cationic, anionic, and non-ionic surfactants on the morphology of PBZ-derived carbon was investigated, and it was determined that the type of surfactant had a major impact on the morphology of the PBZ-derived carbon. Moreover, using a higher surfactant concentration led to a larger pore size, pore volume, and specific surface area. The high efficiency of the PBZ-derived carbon for CO2 adsorption was confirmed by CO2-TPD, FT-IR, and SEM. Notably, the carbon modified by the P123 surfactant delivered a high CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.59 mmol g−1, which was 2 times higher than that of unmodified carbon."
Transition Pathway Palm Oil Research Framework Toward a Bio-Circular-Green Economy Model Using SWOT Analysis: A Case Study of Thailand,"Rajamangala University of Technology Rattanakosin, Chulalongkorn University, Srinakharinwirot University, Agricultural Research Development Agency (Public Organization), Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"Copyright © 2022 Usapein, Tuntiwiwattanapun, Polburee, Veerakul, Seekao and Chavalparit.Climate change, food security, and energy crisis are becoming more intense in our world. Oil palm can be utilized in both the food and biofuel industries. To respond to the crisis, it is necessary to develop palm oil products besides vegetable oil and biodiesel. This article focuses on the development of strategies to research oil palm throughout the supply chain in Thailand. The SWOT factors (the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) are recognized via interviews with stakeholders. These stakeholders are feedstock producers, crude palm oil (CPO) producers, government agencies, biodiesel producers, palm oil refinery producers, and researchers. The results obtained from the data collection were analyzed and led to the formulation of strategies for future research on oil palm by the TOWS matrix. According to this analysis, future palm oil research framework strategies should consist of four categories: (1) oil palm management policy, developing regulation and economic instruments of various forms to systematically manage the oil palm industry, and applying big data and smart innovation to analyze market behavior; (2) oil palm breeding and production technologies, developing smart innovation in line with farmers’ lifestyles, and supporting research on oil content analysis and harvesting technology; (3) oil palm biomass conversion technologies, assessing environmental impacts through life cycle technology, evaluating the potential reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing the consumption rate of palm biomass; and (4) palm-based oleochemical products, developing oleochemical technology at the industrial level, expanding the potential capacity of producing oleochemical derivative products, and increasing the consumption rate and value added of CPO. All four frameworks were detailed and revised in line with the information obtained from seminars, comments, and interviews to meet the needs of all stakeholders. This framework will help drive the Bio-Circular-Green economy model in the future."
The effects of land-based change on coastal ecosystems,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering.The rapid increase in coastal urbanization profoundly impacts various environmental components and significantly transforms coastal ecosystems to the degree they lose their integrity. Coastal zones are facing increasing pressure from socio-economic development and climate change. Sustainable coastal planning and management must understand better how humans changing the physical environment of coastal areas to present a rational and comprehensive direction for development. The purpose of this research is to systematically review, with the following aims: (1) describe scientific debates on anthropogenic activities on the coastal landscape; (2) systematically identify the landscape structure of the changing coastal ecosystem; and (3) discuss the consequences of the change. Research articles from the database are systematically mapped and reviewed to summarize the state of current evidence-based information related to the characters and effects of change. The 114 articles selected indicate that there are numerous adverse actions and consequences of anthropogenic landscape change. Humans significantly influence the structure of the coastal ecosystem. Consequently, the functions of the coastal ecosystem are altered and degraded. This review proposed spatial planning guidelines to maintain or restore the ecological integrity of coastal development, especially where only small portions of formerly intact coastal ecosystems remain."
Low-temperature alcohol-assisted methanol synthesis from CO2 and H2: The effect of alcohol type,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCCarbon dioxide (CO2) conversion to higher-value products is a promising pathway to mitigate CO2 emissions. Methanol is a high-value-chain chemical in industries that can be produced through CO2 hydrogenation, which is an exothermic reaction. Due to thermodynamic limitations, a typical synthesis temperature between 250 °C and 300 °C results in a low conversion of CO2 at equilibrium. To enhance the CO2 conversion, high pressures of 50–100 bar are required, which inevitably causes the process to be energy-intensive. In this study, an alternative method called alcohol-assisted methanol synthesis is investigated. In this method, alcohol is used as a catalytic solvent and helps decrease the reaction temperature and pressure (150 °C and 50 bar) and significantly increases methanol yield. Ethanol is used as the alcohol due to its reactivity, providing a high methanol yield (47.80%) with 63.93% CO2 conversion and 67.54% methanol selectivity. However, due to unwanted side reactions, ethanol generates ethyl acetate as a byproduct that forms an azeotrope with methanol, leading to difficulty in product purification. The effects of alcohol type (molecular weight and structure), including ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, iso-butanol, tert-butanol and 1-pentanol, on CO2 conversion, methanol yield and byproducts are investigated. It is found that smaller-molecule alcohols provide a higher methanol yield. Moreover, n-alcohols provide a higher methanol yield than branched alcohols, and the byproducts of the reaction with n-alcohols do not form an azeotrope with methanol. Therefore, 1-propanol is compared with ethanol providing 26.55% methanol yield, 69.02% CO2 conversion and 70.82% methanol selectivity."
Atomic- and Molecular-Level Modulation of Dispersed Active Sites for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction,"Chulalongkorn University, Mahidol University",2023,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Global climate changes have been impacted by the excessive CO2 emission, which exacerbates the environmental problems. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) offers the solution for utilising CO2 as feedstocks for value-added products while potentially mitigating the negative effects. Owing to the extreme stability of CO2, selectivity and efficiency are crucial factors in the development of CO2RR electrocatalysts. Recently, single-atom catalysts have emerged as potential electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. They generally comprise of atomically- and molecularly dispersed active sites over conductive supports, which enable atomic-level and molecular-level modulations. In this minireview, catalyst preparations, principle of modulations, and reaction mechanisms are summarised together with related recent advances.

Socio-Economic Resilience to Floods in Coastal Areas of Thailand,"Thammasat University, United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS Regional Support Team for Asia and the Pacific, Chulalongkorn University, Mahidol University, Edge Hill University",2022,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Krabi and Nakhon Si Thammarat are two coastal provinces in Thailand facing substantial threats from climate change induced hydrometeorological hazards, including enhanced coastal erosion and flooding. Human populations and livelihoods in these coastal provinces are at greater risk than those in inland provinces. However, little is known about the communities’ resilience and coping capacities regarding hydrometeorological hazards of varying magnitudes. The study conducted a quantitative socio-economic assessment of how people in Krabi and Nakhon Si Thammarat provinces manage and respond to hydrometeorological hazards, examining their resilience and coping capacities. This was a cross-sectional study based on secondary data collection on the social and economic dimensions of resilience, and a review of literature on coping mechanisms to hydrometeorological hazards within the study area. Measuring and mapping socio-economic resilience was based on the available data gathered from the social and economic dimensions, with existing or standard indicators on exposure and vulnerability applied uniformly across subdistricts. A combination of social and economic dimensions produced novel socio-economic resilience index scores by subdistrict, which were mapped accordingly for the two coastal provinces. The study also derived a coping capacity index scores by combining availability of skills or soft capacity and availability of structural resources or hard coping capacity. Socio-economic resilience index scores varied greatly amongst subdistricts. Combining the soft and hard coping capacities, the average score across districts in both provinces was 3 out of a possible 4, meaning that most of the districts were largely resilient. However, variations also existed by subdistrict. Few subdistricts in both Krabi and Nakhon Si Thammarat provinces had low coping capacity index scores between 1 and 2 out of 4. District averages of socio-economic resilience scores mask the variations at subdistrict level. More studies with rigorous methodologies at village or neighborhood level is needed to obtain a nuanced understanding of community resilience to hydrometeorological hazards."
Possible Pathways toward Carbon Neutrality in Thailand’s Electricity Sector by 2050 through the Introduction of H2 Blending in Natural Gas and Solar PV with BESS,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.To avoid the potential adverse impacts of climate change from global warming, it is suggested that the target of net zero emissions should be reached by this mid-century. Thailand is aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Since electricity generation is one of the largest producers of carbon dioxide emission, the associated emissions must be greatly reduced to achieve the targets mentioned above. Thus, new generation expansion plans must be well developed. This paper discusses the development of generation expansion plans considering Thailand’s latest policies along with enhancement of the existing multi-period linear programming model, allowing new electricity generation technologies having low emissions, e.g., solar PV with battery and hydrogen blending in natural gas, to be integrated into generation expansion planning. Then, four generation expansion plans with different levels of hydrogen blending in natural gas are proposed and discussed. It is found that Thailand can achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 by promoting more use of renewable energy altogether with trade-off between land for solar PV installation and amount of hydrogen blended in natural gas. The lesson learned from this study provides crucial information about possible pathways to achieve carbon neutrality in the electricity sector for policy makers in other countries."
Mapping Risk of Nipah Virus Transmission from Bats to Humans in Thailand,"Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University, Kasetsart University, Kasetsart University, Chulalongkorn University, EcoHealth Alliance, Kasetsart University, Mahidol University",2022,"© 2022, EcoHealth Alliance.Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic virus that can pose a serious threat to human and livestock health. Old-world fruit bats (Pteropus spp.) are the natural reservoir hosts for NiV, and Pteropus lylei, Lyle’s flying fox, is an important host of NiV in mainland Southeast Asia. NiV can be transmitted from bats to humans directly via bat-contaminated foods (i.e., date palm sap or fruit) or indirectly via livestock or other intermediate animal hosts. Here we construct risk maps for NiV spillover and transmission by combining ecological niche models for the P. lylei bat reservoir with other spatial data related to direct or indirect NiV transmission (livestock density, foodborne sources including fruit production, and human population). We predict the current and future (2050 and 2070) distribution of P. lylei across Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Our best-fit model predicted that central and western regions of Thailand and small areas in Cambodia are currently the most suitable habitats for P. lylei. However, due to climate change, the species range is predicted to expand to include lower northern, northeastern, eastern, and upper southern Thailand and almost all of Cambodia and lower southern Vietnam. This expansion will create additional risk areas for human infection from P. lylei in Thailand. Our combined predictive risk maps showed that central Thailand, inhabited by 2.3 million people, is considered highly suitable for the zoonotic transmission of NiV from P. lylei. These current and future NiV transmission risk maps can be used to prioritize sites for active virus surveillance and developing awareness and prevention programs to reduce the risk of NiV spillover and spread in Thailand."

Hence, the main goal of the present work is to achieve the visible light activity using the synthesized photocatalyst for hydrogen production through water splitting. Hydrogen exists in nature and benefits the ecosystem by reducing the carbon emissions in the environment. Therefore, it is a self-motivated choice of researchers to produce hydrogen in large scale to save the environment from severe pollution hazards. Meanwhile, photocatalytic activity proves to be the excellent source for hydrogen generation. In this connection, the nanocomposite TiO2-V2O5 was synthesized by blending both sol-gel and thermal decomposition methods. The structural and morphological properties, surface area determination, absorption and band gap studies were carried out via various sophisticated instruments. The TiO2-V2O5 composite system exhibits lower band gap that favored the photocatalytic activity in promoting hydrogen production."
"High resolution luminescence chronology of coastal dune deposits near Chumphon, Western Gulf of Thailand","University of Freiburg, University of Groningen, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2022The development of coastal dunes is linked to environmental controls such as sea-level variability, climatic conditions, and coastal morphology. Understanding the spatial and temporal variations of dunes is crucial for predicting how coastal landscapes may react to future climate changes and sea-level rise. However, there are very few detailed studies on the longer time-scale evolution (centennial to millennial) of coastal dunes from subtropical and tropical regions. Here, we combine a high-resolution luminescence chronology with sedimentological analyses to study the depositional history of a transverse coastal dune located within the Bang Berd dune field, Western Gulf of Thailand. While luminescence dating of uniform aeolian deposits is normally straight forward, we observe strong variations in the natural dose rate which are likely explained by the enrichment of accessory minerals in some laminae. Deposition of the dune started at least around 3000 years ago and coincides with a regional sea level drop. Sedimentary structures indicate deposition occurring predominantly in relation to the northeasterly winter monsoon. As the sea-level rise and increased storm intensity in the future may lead to stronger erosion along the coast, this study is highlighting the importance of the Bang Berd dune system as natural protection against coastal inundation."
Increased frequency of extreme rainfall events threatens an emblematic cultural coastal agroecosystem in Southeastern Thailand,"Chulalongkorn University, UMR G-EAU, IRD, Institut Agro, CIRAD",2023,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Coastal agricultural systems in Southeast Asia are vulnerable to climate change. The combination of rising sea levels and extreme rainfall events is eroding fragile coastlines that protect emblematic “rice bowls” across the region. A series of recent damaging floods in Southeastern Thailand has raised concerns about their increased frequency. Local and regional trends in rainfall variables relevant to farming were investigated using the resampling-based Mann–Kendall test applied to four rainfall stations of the Songkhla lagoon basin during the period 1957–2019. Using the findings from long-term and multi-scale agrarian change surveys based on Mazoyer and Roudard’s methodology, a vulnerability framework was used to assess the sensitivity and response capacity to these trends of the great Songkhla spit agroecosystem. Significant positive trends in the rainfall depth, number of rainy days, and maximum daily rainfall were observed in January at individual stations and across the region, especially since the early 1980s. Moreover, the annual frequency of extreme rainfall events consistently increased over the same period. The impacts on the unstable coastal main sandbar that protects the flood plain are discussed, while the effects on rice production are analyzed. The coping responses of the cultural rice and sugar palm-based agroforestry system, and the lack of adaptation of recent land-use changes are examined. The agro-ecological, economic, and social importance of the dense hedges of sugar palms to mitigate climatic risks and maintain the resilience of local livelihood systems is underlined. Propositions for short and longer-term measures to adapt water management, diversify cropping systems, and foster participatory disaster risk management are made."
The Linkages between Air Quality Management Related Research and Sustainable Development in Thailand,"Chulalongkorn University, King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang",2023,"© 2022, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment. All rights reserved.Air pollution is considered one of the greatest environmental threats to human health in our era. This study aimed to evaluate the linkages between related research and studies on air quality management and the global sustainable development goals (SDGs) and to investigate strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of air quality management strategies in Thailand. By employing the Scale Assessment Method, the results found that SDGs related to human well-being, cities, and climate change were associated with several studies with medium to high level of agreement and evidence. In accordance with SDG 3, many scholars have been performed to investigate the relationship between both long-term and short-term exposure of air pollution and human health. In SDG 11, many cities are increasing concerned about air pollution, especially the annual mean of particulate matter in cities. Regarding SDG 13, although there is no specific headline goal on air pollution and climate change, there are some research papers available on the development of combined climate change and air quality database in Thailand. In terms of SWOT analysis, availability of research database on multi-pollutant models and research prioritization on air pollution topics were identified as key strengths. Lack of integration of air pollution and cross-cutting issues were defined as major weakness. Impacts of COVID-19 on the research direction and budget allocation were categorized as threats in driving air quality management and research development. Multi-dimensional and inter-sectoral."
Computational fluid dynamics simulation of internally circulating fluidized bed reactor for dry reforming of methane,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2021 The Author(s)Internally circulating fluidized bed reactor (ICFB) is the reactor that combines the conventional circulating fluidized bed (CFB) reactor system, including riser, downer, loop seal and cyclones, into a single compact reactor column. The ICFB reactor column is separated into two sections (riser and downer) by baffles and is linked together via connecting ports. The solid particles are circulated in the ICFB reactor by unequal fluidizing velocities in the riser and downer sections. The solid particles in the downer section are operated with low fluidizing velocity in the bubbling fluidization regime. In the riser section, the solid particles are transferred to the downer section because of the high fluidizing velocity. In this study, the carbon dioxide reforming or dry reforming reaction of methane was investigated. Dry reforming is a reaction between carbon dioxide and methane, which are the major greenhouse gases, for producing syngas, hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The hydrodynamics and dry reforming reaction with different reactor designs were explored using two-dimensional Eulerian–Eulerian computational fluid dynamics simulation (CFD). The ICFB reactor with no elevation gas distributor, 90 cm of draft tube height, 2 cm of loop-seal length and 1 cm of gas outlet diameter gave the highest methane conversion of 15.4%. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that the length of loop-seal and the gas outlet diameter gave substantial negative and positive effects on methane conversion, respectively. The interaction between length of loop-seal and gas outlet diameter also had a significant effect on the methane conversion. Although the ICFB reactor in this study gave the methane conversion slightly lower than referenced literature conventional CFB reactor, the ICFB reactor is the reactor that can reduce construction cost and simplify complex reactor operation."
Regeneration of modified potassium carbonate with monoethanolamine sorbent supported on gamma-alumina in CO2 capture,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2021,"© 2021 The Author(s)An increase in power demand is one of the key reasons for the global warming problems due to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas emitted into the atmosphere. CO2 capture technology becomes an alternative solution to reduce CO2 emissions. There are many processes for CO2 capture technology. Among these, CO2 adsorption using solid sorbent has been wildly received attention. Most of the study was focused on the adsorption performance of solid sorbent. However, only a few studies were focusing on the regeneration of solid sorbent. This study investigated the effects of regeneration temperature and pressure on the regeneration rate of non-modified and modified K2CO3/γ-Al2O3 with monoethanolamine (MEA). The results showed that an increase in regeneration temperature and a decrease in regeneration pressure enhanced the regeneration rate of non-modified and modified K2CO3/γ-Al2O3. Furthermore, the experimental data of the regeneration rate was fitted to Avrami's fractional-order model for further use in other applications."
"Building business, human rights and climate change synergies in Southeast Asia: what the Philippines’ National Inquiry on Climate Change could mean for ASEAN","Stockholm Environment Institute, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2022 The Authors.Climate change has a profound impact on economic growth, development and social progress. Climate action, through greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation to current and predicted effects of climate change, has only recently begun to consider the range of human rights implications both of action and inaction when it comes to mitigating climate impacts. While states are the primary duty bearers for the human rights of their citizens, recent examples of climate change litigation offer unique opportunities to consider the role and responsibilities of corporations for their contributions to anthropogenic climate change. The Philippines’ National Inquiry on Climate Change (NICC) offers an innovative approach to understanding the interplay and synergies between business, human rights and climate change, highlighting the increasing importance of these relationships. Building on the NICC’s preliminary findings, this article considers the nexus between business, human rights and climate change in the ASEAN context and reflects on the significance of domestic climate change litigation for regional governance approaches, policymaking and cooperation."

Countries 2022.This chapter describes the activities, progress and relevance of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment-Southeast Asia (CORDEX-SEA) in providing regional climate change information for enabling adaptation in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia is a region that has been affected by climate change, particularly by the weather and climate extremes, and will likely to be impacted more in the future decades as global temperature continues to increase. The number of climate-related disasters, particularly floods, has increased since the last few decades. For climate resilience, countries in the region need to mitigate and adapt, which both require regional future climate change information. However, for robust formulation of adaptation measures, future climate change information at local scales is required. CORDEX-SEA was established to provide multi-model and high-resolution climate projections and fulfil climate model data requirements in the region. CORDEX-SEA has generated a reasonably good model ensemble of regional climate downscaling from 11 global climate models (GCMs) using 7 regional climate models (RCMs) at a spatial resolution of 25 km. Based on these projections, depending on region and seasons, significant changes in mean and extreme precipitation are projected to occur in the future decades. The generated downscaled data can now be used for climate risk assessment in the Southeast Asia region. Furthermore, the establishment of the Southeast Asia Regional Climate Change Information System (SARCCIS), a data node of the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF), facilitated the data archiving and dissemination of CORDEX-SEA data to end users and scientists involved in the assessment of vulnerability, impacts and adaptation (VIA)."
Potential Impacts of Climatic Stress on the Performance of Phyto-bioremediation Techniques,"Chulalongkorn University (ERIC), Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Thammasat University",2023,"© The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.In this era, climate change is considered one of the greatest sustainability challenges and environmental threats facing our global society. Atmospheric warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) will persist many centuries and continue to change in the global climate system. Evidently, both frequency and intensity of extreme climate events and natural disasters have been observed at the regional, continental, and global scales over comparable time periods, especially the additional warming of 1.5–2.0 °C. In terms of terrestrial biological systems, all microbial mechanisms have caused several changes in the global climate system (i.e. soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, terrestrial biogenic fluxes of GHGs). Although much attention has been paid to the linkage between microbial population and soil GHG fluxes, the significance of microorganism responses to climate-related environmental stress has remained neglected. The overall aim of this chapter is, therefore, to highlight the consequences of global climate change on the performance of bioremediation treatment processes. All potential effects of climatic parameters, such as increased atmospheric temperature and elevated CO2 levels, extreme precipitations, soil moisture, soil warming, water stress (drought) on the microbiological mechanisms (i.e. microbial diversity, structure, physiological change, etc.), fate and behavior of contaminants, the ability of plant to uptake the toxic contaminants the environment, and also the efficiency of bioremediation were critically addressed. Some bioremediation techniques (i.e. phytoremediation) were also emphasized and considered for the impacts of combined climatic stress on soil microbe–plant interactions (i.e. bioavailability and potential mobility of contaminants, etc.). Some sustainable bioremediation options in the climate change era and issues for future research were further discussed."

Various countries have developed new energy policy instruments, such as Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), to promote the growth of RES. RECs are tradable, non-tangible assets, which have a monetary value. Tracking and certification of the origin of an energy resource regardless of its type (e.g., a conventional power plant or RES) are a critical operation. In addition to the certification of origin, trading transactions must be performed using a secure method. Energy industry participants need to secure the data and applications related to RECs. Digitalization technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technology (DLT) are among the most popular and promising options. DLT is a perfect framework that can support such REC functionalities. This paper addresses the cybersecurity aspects in REC trading using blockchain and distributed ledger technology, considering detailed cybersecurity perspectives and aspects of adopting technology from an organizational perspective."
The influence of different crystal modifiers on ultra-low embodied energy curing fiber-reinforced cement composites,"Kasetsart University, UAC Global Public Company Limited, Thammasat University, Michigan Technological University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2022,Journal of Metals, Materials and Minerals. All Rights Reserved.Fiber-reinforced cement composites (FRCC) are widely used in the construction of houses and commercial buildings in many countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, the European countries, and the Asian countries such as China, India, and Thailand. Conventionally, the FRCC is manufactured from Portland cement, silica sand, and cellulose fiber using the so-called autoclaved curing under a designate hydrothermal condition to accelerate the hydration reaction resulting in superior properties. However, the autoclave-curing process needs a huge investment and generates highly environmental impact specially greenhouse gases due to its heavy energy consumption. Hence, this research aims to develop the FRCC with lowering embodied energy via the energy-free moisture curing process. The use of different crystal modifiers (CM) including synthetic tobermorite, aluminosilicate complex, and modified lithium compound in addition of the usual FRCC composition to drive the hydration kinetic and then properties achieved were characterized by the relevance of higher heat of hydration. Moreover, scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to reveal the favorable effects of appropriate CM through the microstructure. The results approved that the FRCC with qualified mechanical performance and densified microstructure was successfully produced by using the appropriate moisture curing condition and CM. Additionally, using alumino-silicate complex as CM at 3% of cement weight produced FRCC with the highest modulus of elasticity of 9,067 ± 492 MPa, and the lowest % water absorption of 27.42 ± 1.65 %."
Methanation Process for Methane Synthesis from Waste Gas: Process Simulation,"Burapha University, Chulalongkorn University, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology",2022,"Copyright © 2022, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.Waste gas from the fermentation of bioethanol production consists of high carbon dioxide concentration. The CO2 emissions cause global climate change. The conversion of carbon dioxide to chemical products or fuels is an interesting solution for reducing the amount of carbon dioxide emissions. The methane synthesis via carbon dioxide methanation reaction has attracted much attention. The suitable operation of the methanation process for methane synthesis from waste gases should be studied. This work aims to investigate the methane production from the waste gas of the fermentation process. The composition of impurities in waste gases on the performance of the methanation process is investigated. The effects of hydrogen to carbon dioxide ratio and operating temperature on the carbon dioxide conversion and methane yield of the methanation are also studied. The simulation results from the thermodynamic analysis show that the methane yield of the methanation from waste gases is 3.11 - 4.61 % higher than that from pure carbon dioxide in the temperature range of 300 - 500 °C. The methane yield of the methanation process decreases with increasing temperature. The increase in the hydrogen to carbon dioxide ratio of 1 to 4 and the operating pressure of 1 to 8 bar have a significant effect on the enhancement of carbon dioxide conversion and methane yield."
Complete design case study for pulp and paper industry,"King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, PSE for SPEED Company Limited, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Pulp and paper industry is a traditional biorefinery system that produces low margin paper products at low innovation development. It needs business transformation to enhance profitability along with efficient material and energy consumption through process development of high-value bioproducts. In response to climate change concerns and declining petroleum resources, the concept of biorefinery has developed using biochemical and thermochemical technologies. To develop biorefinery together with the conventional pulp and paper industry, integrated biorefinery in the existing pulp mill has been designed as a long-term sustainable solution. A systematic framework is needed to synthesize and design promising integrated systems from numerous alternatives. A three-level methodology, involving Level-1 Base Case Design, Level-2 Optimization and Analysis, and Level-3 Innovation, is proposed as an effective approach to determine optimal technologies suitable for the transformation of the traditional system through superstructure optimization, process analysis, and process improvement in terms of economic and environmental issues. To achieve a sustainable development of the integrated biorefinery system, innovative alternatives are discovered to satisfy improvement targets. Computer-aided tools are employed to support systematic data collection, mathematical model formulation, and complicated problem solving. Case studies of synthesis, design and innovation tasks illustrating the application of the framework to obtain promising integrated pulp mill-biorefinery alternatives are presented."
P2P Energy Trading: An Optimal Solution for Energy Shortage in Pakistan,"Department of Electronics and Power Engineering, School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Department of Avionics Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering",2023,"© 2013 IEEE.Green energy can help in protecting the environment. Moreover, its continuous supply increases the quality of life and indeed the economic development of a country. The power sector in Pakistan is continuously under stress due to the imbalance between the demand and supply of energy. Pakistan has abundant renewable energy resources, i.e., solar, hydro, wind, etc., which are the main elements of green energy. This study first evaluates the existing power sector in Pakistan. Then, we proposed a peer-to-peer energy trading framework that helps in reducing the stress on the power sector in Pakistan by meeting the local energy demands of the consumers with the help of local energy generation. In the proposed peer-to-peer energy trading market, a novel method for determining the uniform energy trading price is proposed. This proposed pricing method increases the utilities of the market participants i.e., saving in energy bills for consumers and profitability for the sellers. The proposed study assumes that solar energy is provided from the energy producer side. Solar energy penetration on various ratios starting from 14% to 35% is tested on environment and consumer satisfaction levels. We conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the proposed method and the results suggest that a 35% penetration of solar in each subdivision can be helpful to decrease the current stress on Pakistans' power sector. Furthermore, it also helps in reducing the carbon emission footprint."
Technical insights into carbon dioxide sequestration by microalgae: A biorefinery approach towards sustainable environment,"Bharathiar University, University Kebangsaan Malaysia, Chulalongkorn University",2022,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The escalating level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere poses a severe environmental issue. Vital steps have to be taken to ensure that this emission of gases is reduced to acceptable levels. One such way is CO2 sequestration using microalgae. Microalgae is a simple photosynthetic microorganism that could be a group of unicellular or simple multicellular forms that can fix this atmospheric CO2 or from many other sources such as exhaust gases to minimize the amount released to the air. This review deals with different designs of microalgae photobioreactors and the production of valuable biomass, which may help in the study of implementing a better, larger, and economically sustainable system to sequester a much amount of CO2 and the wide range of value-added products with harvested biomass. In addition, physicochemical factors’ influence on photobioreactor configurations for improvement of biomass productivity and CO2 sequestration are also discussed. Moreover, algal bio-refinery idea is introducing a variety of industrial applications and makes this more economic feasibility of CO2 sequestration."
Enhanced Virtualization-Based Dynamic Bin-Packing Optimized Energy Management Solution for Heterogeneous Clouds,"Chitkara University, KIET Group of Institutions, Taif University, Govt. Bikram Colleges of Commerce, LBEF Campus, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2022 Neha Gupta et al.Cloud computing provides unprecedented advantages of using computing resources with very less efforts and cost. The energy utilization in cloud data centers has forced the cloud service providers to raise the expense of using its services and has increased the carbon footprints in the environment. Many static bin-packing algorithms exist which can reduce energy by some percentage, but with new era of digitization, advanced and dynamic techniques are required which can serve heterogeneous users and random users' requests. Thus, in this paper, two new dynamic best-fit decreasing-based bin-packing algorithms are proposed wherein the first technique is for service providers and focuses on increasing server utilization and the second approach acts as a switcher to harness best results among all algorithms. Both techniques deliberately achieve high performance in terms of total energy consumption, resource utilization, and makespan along with serving continuous and varying requests from customers. The simulations are performed using Java. The results exhibited that DEE-BFD can escalate resource utilization by 96% and EM switcher can reduce total energy consumption by 49% and reduce makespan by 56%."
PTAD: A web-based climate service for building design adaptation,"Maejo University, Chulalongkorn University, Royal Irrigation Department",2022,"© 2021Projections Tool for Architectural Design (PTAD) is a web-based climate service product available at www.ptad.mju.ac.th. Targeted at building owners and designers, it is intended to support these decision makers in building design to reduce the impacts of climate change. This study presents the technical environment of PTAD and provides a conceptual basis for linking academic information on climate change to building-related data with the cooperation of the relevant authorities. The PTAD development concept was divided into three parts: climate change impact assessment in small areas (i.e., at a construction site scale), building damage analysis of the impacts, and climate-resilient recommendations for building design. Tools such as GIS, HEC-RAS, and ERDAS and the existing outputs of regional climate models were used as the baseline data for analyzing the impacts that may occur at the study site. The impacts in small areas and design strategies to reduce the potential damage were analyzed with the Delphi technique using existing standards and guidelines. A 3-tier architecture was employed for the production and development environments by modularizing the user interface, service object, and data storage layers. The impact data values, namely, the highest annual surface temperatures and flood characteristics, including the maximum flood level, flood duration, and water velocity from 1998 to 2047, were displayed as markers on the satellite maps, tables, and figures. The impacts can be linked to architectural design guidelines to help design buildings that mitigate some of the impacts of climate change."
"Strategies for the renovation of old shophouses, built during the 1960s and 1970s in Bangkok (Thailand), for mass adoption and application",Chulalongkorn University,2022,"© 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group on behalf of the Architectural Institute of Japan, Architectural Institute of Korea and Architectural Society of China.This research aimed at developing strategies for the renovation of old shophouses in Bangkok ready for mass adoption and application. Shophouses were built with typical designs in a massive number in Bangkok during the 1960s and 1970s. They are now deteriorating, but still occupy a great proportion of the land near the city center. To make shophouse renovation easy for mass adoption and application will allow Bangkok’s population to have more choices of housing that suit their lifestyle and support their wellbeing. It challenges the mainstream perception of seeing only the choices of living in a condominium near the center or in a suburban house. By observation and literature review, the research categorized typical features and problems of old shophouses into four groups; (i) space and form, (ii) climate, (iii) wellbeing, and (iv) construction. After case studies, designing, and constructing a prototype renovation design, the research concluded with design strategies to increase the space flexibility, climatic responsiveness, safety, aesthetics, and hygiene. Taking procedural and legal limitations, and the minimal involvement of professionals and the authority into account, maintaining particular features of existing buildings as much as possible and adding new features as little as possible were also suggested. These strategies would promote mass renovation of shophouses. By reducing demolition and supporting urban redevelopment, they would potentially help reviving urban heritage and reducing carbon footprint."
"Aromaticity, polarity, and longevity of biochar derived from disposable bamboo chopsticks waste for environmental application","Chulalongkorn University, Pa-deng Biochar Research Center",2023,"© 2023 The AuthorsTransforming disposable bamboo chopstick (DBC) wastes into biochar is an effective way to achieve waste-to-resource conversion. This research focused on the elemental and chemical composition of biochar and revealed how these properties affect biochar performance in real-world applications, particularly with respect to climate change mitigation. This research is aimed at examining the effect of pyrolysis temperature on the aromaticity, polarity, and longevity of DBC biochar. The DBC feedstock was pyrolyzed at different temperatures of 400 °C, 450 °C, 500 °C, and 550 °C with a holding time of 20 min at a constant heating rate of 20 °C min−1. The chemical composition, including carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), volatile matter (VM), ash, and fixed carbon (FC) contents, were analyzed. The aromaticity, polarity, and longevity of biochar are presented by the atomic ratios of H/C, O/C, (O + N)/C, and C/N, and these ratios are used to determine the potential of biochar for use in climate change mitigation applications. The findings demonstrated that DBC biochar produced at various pyrolysis temperatures contained C contents ranging from 77.54% to 88.06%, ash contents ranging from 2.62% to 2.99%, and a half-life of over 1000 years (O/C < 0.2). Pyrolysis temperature significantly affected biochar properties, as supported by the results for the FC/ash ratio (>10); the ash, FC, C, and N contents increased with increasing temperature; in contrast, the VM, H, and O contents decreased. The results revealed that DBC wastes are the potential feedstock to produce good-quality biochar that could be applied for environmental purposes. Furthermore, the research demonstrated that the best-performing DBC biochar was produced at 500 °C, which had the highest C content, aromaticity, and longevity and the lowest polarity as represented by the values of O/C, H/C, and (O + N)/C, and this biochar could be applied for climate change mitigation purposes."
Can 210Pb be used as a paleo-storm proxy?,"Florida State University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, National High Magnetic Field Laboratory",2023,"© 2023 Elsevier LtdThere is increasing interest within the scientific community, as well as the public, to determine if tropical cyclones are increasing in frequency and/or magnitude because of climate change. Unfortunately, the instrumental weather record only extends over the last 100–150 years depending upon location. It is thus desirable to develop paleo-storm proxies to extend the tropical cyclone record to hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Overwash sand deposits, sediment grain size, and various geochemical parameters (e.g., δ13C, δ15N, C/N) have been applied successfully for coastal lake sediments. We present here another potential proxy candidate, the natural radionuclide 210Pb. With a 22.2-year half-life, 210Pb age dating is often used to calibrate other proxies over essentially the same period as the instrumental storm record. We hypothesize here that trends in the 210Pb profiles, in addition to providing chronological information, can provide independent records of storm deposits in some situations. To illustrate how 210Pb may serve as an additional storm proxy, we present data from sediment cores collected from the Chao Phraya Delta (Upper Gulf of Thailand), an area characterized by a rapidly retreating shoreline. Some of the 210Pb profiles mark sedimentary layers with anomalously low excess 210Pb activities interspersed between layers with significant excess activities. We suggest that these layers may result from rapid deposition offshore of older storm-eroded shoreline material. The estimated ages of these 210Pb-deficient layers match, within estimated uncertainties, years when typhoons or tropical storms are reported to have severely eroded the nearby Thai coastline. The matching of the time scales of 210Pb and recorded tropical cyclones, both about 100–150 years, allows this approach to be used to explore for storm deposits and tune geochemical and other proxies for extended study over time scales of several decades or longer."
"Carbon emissions, corporate governance, and hostile takeover threats","Chulalongkorn Business School, NTNU Business School, Chulalongkorn University, The University of Western Australia, Pennsylvania State University",2023,"© 2022 The Authors. Business Strategy and The Environment published by ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Exploiting a unique measure of takeover vulnerability principally based on state legislations, we investigate how corporate carbon reduction efforts are influenced by the takeover market, which is widely regarded as a crucial instrument of external corporate governance. Our results show that more takeover exposure brings about significantly greater efforts to reduce carbon emissions. A rise in takeover susceptibility by one standard deviation improves carbon reduction performance by 12.81%. The findings corroborate the notion that the takeover market, acting as an external governance mechanism, compels managers to adopt policies that benefit shareholders in the long run. Our results imply that carbon emissions are a crucial corporate outcome as it is subject to the pressure from the takeover market. Companies should pay a close attention to this matter. Further analysis robustly validates the results, including propensity score matching, entropy balancing, an instrumental variable analysis, and heteroscedastic identification. Our measure of takeover vulnerability is plausibly exogenous and thus probably reveals a causal effect, rather than a mere association."

Published by American Chemical SocietyThis work presents the efficient, green, and low-cost preparation of calcium lactate by using bivalve-shell wastes (cockle, mussel, and oyster shells) as raw materials. Three bivalve shells, a cockle, mussel, and oyster, were used separately as an alternative calcium-source material for the preparation of calcium lactate. The bivalve-shell waste was cleaned and milled, obtaining calcium carbonate (CaCO3) powder, which reacted to the lactic acid, forming calcium lactate. The effects of different calcium sources (cockle, mussel, and oyster) and different lactic acid concentrations (6, 8, and 10 mol/L) on the physicochemical properties of the synthesized calcium lactates were then investigated. The results pointed out that the highest solubility of the product was observed when 6 mol/L lactic acid and cockle-shell derived CaCO3 were employed for the calcium lactate preparation. The thermal decompositions of all calcium lactates occurred in three processes: dehydration, ethyl-lactate elimination, and decarbonization, respectively. The results, obtained from an infrared spectrometer, X-ray diffractometer, thermogravimetric analyzer, and scanning electron microscope, confirmed the formation of calcium lactate pentahydrate (Ca(CH3CHOHCOO)2·5H2O). The diffractograms also indicated the presence of two enantiomers of Ca(CH3CHOHCOO)2·5H2O, namely, of dl- and l-enantiomers, which depended on the lactic acid concentration used in the preparation process. The morphologies of calcium lactates show the firewood-like crystals in different microsizes, together with smaller irregular crystals. In summary, this work reports an effective process to prepare the valuable calcium lactates by using the cheap bivalve-shell-derived CaCO3 as a renewable calcium source."
Enhanced CO2 desorption rate for rich amine solution regeneration over hierarchical HZSM-5 catalyst,"Hunan University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.High energy consumption during the carbon dioxide (CO2) desorption process in amine-based CO2 capture technology is a crucial hindrance to achieving carbon neutrality. HZSM-5 is one of the most widely reported solid acid catalysts used in primary amine regeneration. This work compared a series of HZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios in terms of CO2 desorption performance. To further enhance catalytic activity, hierarchical HZSM-5 was synthesized by the dealumination and desilication re-assembly method with different acid and alkali concentrations. The experimental results suggested that desilication by modification in sodium hydroxide resulted in a significant improvement of mesoporous surface area. The NaOH-0.4 catalyst could improve the amount of desorbed CO2 by 40.3% and decrease the relative heat duty by 28.5%. And the cyclic tests revealed that catalytic activity was well preserved in the recycling process. Moreover, the structure and acidity of modification samples were characterized by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transforms infrared (FT-IR), Nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiment, temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD), Pyridine-adsorption infrared spectroscopy (Py-IR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The characterization results suggested that the synergistic effect of larger mesoporous surface area and total acid sites was important to enhance catalytic CO2 desorption performance. These results showed a new understanding of catalyst design for CO2 capture technology by modifying the structure of the catalyst support."
Climate change and food security at household level in the central dry zone in Myanmar,Chulalongkorn University,2023,"© 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The central dry zone of Myanmar is a climatic risk area in which the inhabitants are experiencing food insecurity, demonstrating the link between water scarcity and climate risk in agricultural production. Households in the region face the challenge of developing adaptation strategies to cope with the impact of climate change on food security. This study aims to seek an effective climate change solution and analyse its impact on Myanmar's food security and household adaptation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw on insights from mixed-method research using a qualitative method followed by quantitative methods. In the qualitative phase, the authors used purposive sampling with two focus group discussions and three stakeholder interviews. In the quantitative phase, data were collected from 102 face-to-face interviews with members of households selected from Pauk Township, Pakokku District, Magway Region, Myanmar. The household food insecurity access scale (HFIAS) was used in the analysis. Findings: The HFIAS indicated that 13% of households have adapted to climate change. The study illustrates that climate change adaptation strategies in production activities are related to food insecurity. The results further demonstrated the effect of climate change on crops, which impacts debt, access to food, selling assets and urban migration. The findings also suggest that climate change adaptation to improve food security has played an important role in providing outside support, which leads to household food insecurity. Originality/value: To the authors' best knowledge, the study is one of the first to use mixed-method research to investigate climate change, food security and household adaptation in the central dry zone of Myanmar."
Fundamental Shift From Summer to Winter of Holocene Rainfall Regime in the Tropics,"Chinese Academy of Sciences, China-Pakistan Joint Research Center on Earth Sciences, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Chulalongkorn University, Tianjin University, Xi'an Jiaotong University, CMA Earth System Modeling and Prediction Centre, Chinses Academy of Meteorological Sciences, The Ohio State University",2023,"© 2023. The Authors.The seasonal rainfall regime is a key factor control on local ecological and social processes and is commonly thought to be stable under long-term climate changes. Here we present a unique high-resolution rainfall record from the Thai-Malay Peninsula, combined with a state-of-the-art transient climate simulation, demonstrating a fundamental rainfall regime shift from summer to winter during the Holocene. Transient model simulation and new sensitivity experiments further reveal that westward migration of the boundary between summer and winter rainfall regimes results in a summer to winter rainfall regime shift forced by distinct changes in summer and winter monsoons. Our findings suggest that the seasonal rainfall regime could be unstable under climate change around the boundaries of rainfall regimes in the tropics and possibly worldwide, which might be more critical for shaping both past and future ecological environments."
Assessment on Energy Technology Toward Carbon Neutrality Policy Using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis: A Case of Thailand,Chulalongkorn University,2023,"© 2023, Econjournals. All rights reserved.The assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation technologies creates a knowledge database to support a national strategy to meet Thailand’s GHG emission reduction target. Such a database also makes important contributions to the formulation of research policy and the country’s broader technological development. Thailand needs a strong technological base in order to meet its national policy targets and international obligations for reducing GHG emissions, as well as to reduce the negative effects of economic activity on society and the environment and to create additional value. The goal of this study is to prioritize energy technologies so that Thailand can achieve its carbon neutrality goal by the year 2050. Multi-criteria decision making is applied with quantitative data on GHG mitigation options. Decisions are made based on the technology’s readiness and level of its impact on economic, social and environmental development. Critical issues representing needs and barriers for selected key technologies are analyzed. The results indicate that solar energy and electric vehicle are selected as having the highest priority, followed by energy efficiency and other renewable energy sources. Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), green hydrogen, and carbon sinks are the last choices with high uncertainty about commercialization."
"Towards sustainability through the circular economy of plastic packaging waste management in Rayong Province, Thailand","Chulalongkorn University, King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.The circularity of plastic packaging waste (PPW) material via recycling is critical to its circular economy towards sustainability and carbon neutrality of society. The multi-stakeholders and complex waste recycling loop of Rayong Province, Thailand, is herein analysed using an actor-network theory to identify key actors, roles, and responsibilities in the recycling scheme. The results depict the relative function of three-actor networks, namely policy, economy, and societal networks, which play different roles in PPW handling from its generation through various separations from municipal solid wastes to recycling. The policy network comprises mainly national authorities and committees responsible for targeting and policymaking for local implementation, while economic networks are formal and informal actors acting for PPW collection with a recycling contribution of 11.3–64.1%. A societal network supports this collaboration for knowledge, technology, or funds. Two waste recycling models are classified as community-based and municipality-based management, which functions differently by coverage areas, capabilities, and process efficiency. The economic reliability of each informal sorting activity is a crucial factor for sustainability, while empowering people in environmental awareness and sorting ability at the household level is also essential, as well as law enforcement that is effective in the long-term circularity of the PPW economy."
How susceptible are rainbow trout and brown trout to infection with tilapia lake virus at increased water temperature – Is there any potential for climate change driven host jump?,"University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, National Veterinary Research Institute, Kasetsart University, Jagiellonian University, Miguel Hernández University (UMH), Chulalongkorn University, Mansoura University, International Centre of Excellence for Aquatic Animal Health",2023,"© 2023In poikilothermic animals like fish, outbreaks of pathogen-related diseases are closely related with the temperature of the surrounding environment. Many salmonid fish species are thermally sensitive and therefore are especially endangered by thermal stress and habitat loss caused by increasing temperatures during summer heat waves. We hypothesized that combining thermal stress and the presence of a novel viral pathogen from for example aquaculture effluents may result in a potential host jump of the pathogen. This could be one of the mechanisms leading to an increased vulnerability of salmonids to a novel disease. Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) could be considered as one of the most dangerous emerging viruses affecting warm water aquaculture of Nile tilapia. This pathogen has a global reach with a yet to be defined host range. The aim of this study was to assess the potential for TiLV to infect salmonid hosts in a range of water temperatures which can be reached during summer heatwaves in Continental Europe. For this, it was established that TiLV can replicate in vitro in salmonid cells over the wide temperature range of 15 °C to 25 °C. The susceptibility of rainbow trout and brown trout juveniles to infection with TiLV was investigated in infection trials based on cohabitation and on intraperitoneal injection of the virus in elevated water temperatures of 20 °C and 25 °C. These experiments showed that if the ability of the virus to enter the organism is considered, the susceptibility of rainbow and brown trout to the virus is low. The exposure of these salmonids to the virus by cohabitation did not lead to high virus loads in the liver and brain. However, the permissivity, i.e. the ability of the virus to replicate in the fish body, is high, because IP-injections of TiLV led to a high virus replication in internal organs. Therefore, TiLV could have some pathogenic potential in salmonids which might be exacerbated by climate change and anthropogenic activities."
"Starch-Reinforced Vinylogous Urethane Vitrimer Composites: An Approach to Biobased, Reprocessable, and Biodegradable Materials","Universität Hamburg, Chulalongkorn University, Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon",2023,"© 2023 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.Vitrimers represent permanent and dynamic polymer networks at the same time. The combination of dynamic covalent bonds and widely available, biodegradable, and biobased raw materials enables new polymers with an excellent carbon footprint, mechanical properties, and outstanding features in terms of multiple recycling methods, e.g., thermomechanical, chemical, and biological reprocessing/reusability. Natural corn starch granules have been surface-modified by an acetoacetylation reaction without using any additional solvent and maintaining the inner semicrystalline structure, giving a polyfunctional cross-linker for starch-reinforced vitrimer composites. Vinylogous urethane vitrimer matrices were synthesized by the condensation reaction of fully acetoacetylated glycerol and different diamines, while glycerol and the diamines were deliberately selected as potentially biobased raw materials. Seven different matrix vitrimers were synthesized with a content of 0-70 wt % of modified starch and investigated in terms of their thermal and mechanical properties. In total, 20 elastomeric and thermosetting materials have been prepared, exhibiting high elastic moduli of 2 GPa with short stress relaxation times and a high content of modified starch up to 70 wt %. The composites show low swelling ratios, suppressing the natural gelatinization of starch in water. Moreover, suitable thermomechanical, chemical, and enzymatic recycling methods for closed-loop cycles, remolding, reusability, and biodegradability were developed."
GIS-based potential assessment of floating photovoltaic systems in reservoirs of Tamil Nadu in India,"Independent Researcher (Structural Engineering), Chulalongkorn University, University of Naples Federico II",2023,"© 2023 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of National Institute of Clean-and-Low-Carbon Energy.Floating photovoltaic systems (FPVs) are one of the emerging renewable-energy technologies suitable for implementation in land-scarce areas around the world. The installation of FPVs in water bodies in highly populated countries such as India will improve renewable-energy production with added advantages in terms of efficiency, water savings and reduced carbon emissions. In this context, the present study aims to identify suitable reservoirs for solar energy production using FPV technology in Tamil Nadu, India using geographic information system techniques. A total of 118 reservoirs located in the study area were considered. The results have shown that the implementation of FPV systems will significantly improve the production of renewable energy. The most suitable reservoirs with hydroelectric power plants for hybrid FPV implementation and their potential to reduce water evaporation and carbon emissions are presented. The results reveal that hybrid systems will generate 1542.53 GWh of power annually and also save 36.32 × 106 m3 of water every year. The results of this investigation will aid in fulfilling sustainable energy production in India, and the methodology presented may be useful for the analysis and prioritization of reservoirs for the implementation of FPV all over the world."
Roles of qseC mutation in bacterial resistance against anti-lipopolysaccharide factor isoform 3 (ALFPm3),"Mahidol University, Mahidol University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Kasetsart University",2023,"© 2023 Khunsri et al.Propelled by global climate changes, the shrimp industry has been facing tremendous losses in production due to various disease outbreaks, particularly early mortality syndrome (EMS), a disease caused by Vibrio parahaemolyticus AHPND. Not only is the use of antibiotics as EMS control agents not yet been proven successful, but the overuse and misuse of antibiotics could also worsen one of the most challenging global health issues-antimicrobial resistance. To circumvent antibiotic usage, anti-lipopolysaccharide factor isoform 3 (ALFPm3), an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) derived from the shrimp innate immune system, was proposed as an antibiotic alternative for EMS control. However, prolonged use of AMPs could also lead to bacterial cross resistance with life-saving antibiotics used in human diseases. Here, we showed that ALFPm3-resistant strains of E. coli could be induced in vitro. Genome analysis of the resistant mutants revealed multiple mutations, with the most interesting being a qseC(L299R). A study of antibiotic susceptibility profile showed that the resistant strains harboring the qseC(L299R) not only exhibited higher degree of resistance towards polymyxin antibiotics, but also produced higher biofilm under ALFPm3 stress. Lastly, a single cell death analysis revealed that, at early-log phase when biofilm is scarce, the resistant strains were less affected by ALFPm3 treatment, suggesting additional mechanisms by which qseC orchestrates to protect the bacteria from ALFPm3. Altogether, this study uncovers involvement of qseC mutation in mechanism of resistance of the bacteria against ALFPm3 paving a way for future studies on sustainable use of ALFPm3 as an EMS control agent."
Modelling the impact of climate change on dengue outbreaks and future spatiotemporal shift in Pakistan,"Health Services Academy, Ministry of Climate Change, National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), Federal University of Itajubá (UNIFEI), Federal Government Polyclinic (PGMI), National Institute of Health, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.Climate change has a significant impact on the intensity and spread of dengue outbreaks. The objective of this study is to assess the number of dengue transmission suitable days (DTSD) in Pakistan for the baseline (1976–2005) and future (2006–2035, 2041–2070, and 2071–2099) periods under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenarios. Moreover, potential spatiotemporal shift and future hotspots of DTSD due to climate change were also identified. The analysis is based on fourteen CMIP5 models that have been downscaled and bias-corrected with quantile delta mapping technique, which addresses data stationarity constraints while preserving future climate signal. The results show a higher DTSD during the monsoon season in the baseline in the study area except for Sindh (SN) and South Punjab (SP). In future periods, there is a temporal shift (extension) towards pre- and post-monsoon. During the baseline period, the top ten hotspot cities with a higher frequency of DTSD are Karachi, Hyderabad, Sialkot, Jhelum, Lahore, Islamabad, Balakot, Peshawar, Kohat, and Faisalabad. However, as a result of climate change, there is an elevation-dependent shift in DTSD to high-altitude cities, e.g. in the 2020s, Kotli, Muzaffarabad, and Drosh; in the 2050s, Garhi Dopatta, Quetta, and Zhob; and in the 2080s, Chitral and Bunji. Karachi, Islamabad, and Balakot will remain highly vulnerable to dengue outbreaks for all the future periods of the twenty-first century. Our findings also indicate that DTSD would spread across Pakistan, particularly in areas where we have never seen dengue infections previously. The good news is that the DTSD in current hotspot cities is projected to decrease in the future due to climate change. There is also a temporal shift in the region during the post- and pre-monsoon season, which provides suitable breeding conditions for dengue mosquitos due to freshwater; therefore, local authorities need to take adaption and mitigation actions."
Can Drones Help Smallholder Farmers Improve Agriculture Efficiencies and Reduce Food Insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa? Local Perceptions from Malawi,"Johns Hopkins University, Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR), Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR), Kyoto University, Chulalongkorn University, Rakuno Gakuen University",2023,"© 2023 by the authors.Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa play a vital role in achieving food security and nutrition, yet they are often overlooked by development policies and lack access to the technology and information needed to increase their agricultural productivity. This is particularly true in Malawi, where smallholder farmers make up over 80% of the population and face a range of risks and challenges, including vulnerability to climate change, that threaten their livelihoods, food security, and nutrition. While drones and precision agriculture technology have had a significant impact on agriculture in high-income countries, their application by smallholder farmers in low-income countries is not well understood. This study, conducted in 2022, examines how drones can assist smallholder farmers in increasing their agricultural productivity and food security in Malawi. It explores how smallholders perceive the use of drones and the potential benefits and limitations of using drones in their farming operations. A unique aspect of this study aims to understand smallholders’ perceptions of open data and data privacy. The results show that when smallholder farmers interact with drone data, they have a better understanding of their farm and are able to make more informed decisions that use fewer inputs and reduce production costs. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential for drones to assist smallholder farmers improve their on-farm knowledge, increase agricultural productivity, and mitigate the risks and challenges they face, leading to improved livelihoods and a more sustainable and secure food supply. Policymakers can promote the adoption of drone technology among smallholder farmers by developing policies that encourage public–private partnerships to create affordable, locally adapted drone technologies and programs that meet their unique needs, while also ensuring responsible use of drones in agriculture through regulations that address concerns about data privacy and security."
An updated review on integration of solar photovoltaic modules and heat pumps towards decarbonization of buildings,"University of Tehran, Chulalongkorn University, VSB—Technical University of Ostrava, Al-Mustaqbal University College, Shahrood University of Technology",2023,"© 2022Heating and cooling are responsible for considerable portion of final energy consumption in the world especially in the residential sector. In order to decrement the pollutants and energy consumption, it is essential to apply promising technologies with proper performance and reliability. Regarding the better performance of heat pumps, in term of energy consumption and environmental effects, compared with the conventional cooling and heating technologies, these systems have attracted attentions in recent years. These systems can become more environmentally friendly by integration with other renewable energy systems and clean technologies. PV module, as a clean technology for power generation can be integrated with heat pumps to enhance the overall performance in terms of Coefficient of Performance (COP), environment and economy. Regarding several advantageous of these systems and existence of different configurations and systems, i.g. conventional, solar-assisted and ground source heat pumps, and great progress on their modification by the scholars, it is requisite to provide an updated and complete review on these systems by considering various technologies and particular focus on the recent research works. In this study, research works on the heat pumps systems integrated with PV modules are reviewed and their findings are discussed. According to the findings of the reviewed researches, the systems performance is depending on various elements such as the operating condition, configuration of the system, characteristics of the units etc. Making use of PV cells and integrating them with heat pumps could lead to energy and cost saving. For instance, it has been observed that by using hybrid systems composed of optimal control, PV cells, heat pumps and wind energy, energy saving of more than 50 % is achievable. Aside from the technical and cost benefits of using the PV integrated heat pumps, CO2 emission can be reduced, by up to 73 % reported in a study, for both heating and cooling purposes which means that these systems are proper towards decarbonization in buildings."
A comprehensive and updated review on the exergy analysis of ground source heat pumps,"Xiangnan University, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Chulalongkorn University, Al-Mustaqbal University College",2023,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdHeat pumps are efficient and attainable alternatives for the conventional systems used for cooling and heating in the buildings. Renewable energy sources can be integrated with heat pumps to improve these systems in term of fossil fuel consumption and mitigation of greenhouse gases. Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHPs), using geothermal energy as heat source, are promising technologies for supplying heating and cooling loads in a clean and sustainable way. Aside from energy analysis, exergetic dimensions of GSHPs has been considered in recent decades. Regarding the advantages of exergy analysis in providing deep insight into the energy systems, this work reviews the study on the exergy analysis of GSHPs. In this regard, this study is performed to provide a comprehensive review on the GSHPs’ exergetic dimensions. According to the findings, exergy efficiency of GSHPs depends on several elements such as the installation depth of the components, specification of the units, dead state temperature, configuration of the system and operation mode. In addition, it is found that irreversibilites of GSHPs is decreasable by utilizing some additional components such as thermoelectric. Furthermore, utilization of material with improved properties such as nanofluids can enhance the exergy efficiency of GSHPs, i.g. 89.7% in optimal concentration compared 88.3% by using base fluid as indicated in one of the studies."
Temporal dynamics of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in Shorea siamensis forest fragments,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological SocietyInvestigating the dynamics of ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) communities in seasonally dry tropical forests is essential for sustainable management and for understanding the resilience of this forest type in future climate change scenarios. EMF communities in secondary forest fragments with Shorea siamensis as a single host tree species in central Thailand were sampled seasonally for 2.5 y. Ten EMF taxa were identified from ectomycorrhizal morphotypes, with/tomentella-thelephora and/russula-lactarius as the dominant taxa. Seasonal differences in EMF diversity were not detected; the dominant morphotypes were present in both seasons and their abundance varied. Most EMF taxa exhibited wide environmental ranges and only a few taxa were correlated with soil moisture. Seasonal dynamics of ectomycorrhizal colonization was likely influenced by climatic factors and the phenology of host species. Together, these results suggested that climatic variation may have a long-term and subtle influence on the composition of ectomycorrhizal communities."
Design and Development of a User-Centered Mobile Application for Intermodal Public Transit in Bangkok: A Design Thinking Approach,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Information and Communication Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2023 Scientific Association for Infocommunications. All rights reserved.With the constant increase in public transit coverage in Bangkok Metropolitan Area in Thailand, many people are still hesitant to switch from using private to public transit, with one potential cause being the unavailability and difficulty in accessing accurate and timely information about their itineraries, while they are commuting. To assess and tackle such issues, the researchers adopted the user-centric Design Thinking methodology to empathize with target users' pain points in this study. They proposed a solution in a user-centric manner by assessing the usability flaws of existing mobile navigation applications, such as Google Maps and ViaBus. By developing a holistic mobile application called 'Disgovery' that covers all modes of public transit in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area and provides relevant information about their trips, the researchers aim to help commuters in Bangkok easily access it in a timely fashion. Through the user-friendly interface, commuters can eliminate the difficulty of finding routes and prices suitable to their needs. By making public transit more accessible with the help of ubiquitous mobile computing, commuters are also encouraged to switch from using private vehicles to public transit, which also can reduce accidents and carbon emissions. The findings from the usability testing in this study suggest that 'Disgovery' is an effective and user-friendly application for daily commuters in Bangkok that can help them achieve their goals without difficulties. The findings also indicate the importance of user interface and user experience guidelines in designing such applications."
EFFECT OF VISUAL STIMULI ON HUMAN THERMAL SENSATION OF SHORT TERM RESIDENTS IN AN OUTDOOR CAMPUS LANDSCAPE IN A TROPICAL CLIMATE,"Meijo University, Sugiyama Jogakuen University, Chulalongkorn University, Kure National College of Technology, Ltd",2023,"© Int. J. of GEOMATE All rights reserved, including making copies unless permission is obtained from the copyright proprietors.Climate change is one of the most serious issues in the recent world. Climate change is known as caused by the increase of carbon dioxide and many countries are forced to take measures. The first big measure was the Paris Agreement in 2015, and many countries joined the agreement. According to the agreement, many of the countries declared major shifts, such as the shift to electric vehicles in the car industry. The biggest concern about climate change at this moment is the rise of the temperature and it causes more death by heat stroke in summer. It also causes more usage of air conditioning systems and emits more carbon dioxide. It became a serious vicious circle. For that reason, it is important to analyze the mechanism of the human thermal sensation, which can be affected by the environmental history of the person, such as the residential area, the length of stay, and so on. In addition, it is expected that the effect of these histories especially appears strongly outdoors. For that reason, the outdoor experiment targeting short-term residents was carried out in Bangkok. For the experiment, 5 measuring points were selected. As a result, a different tendency was grasped at one of the measuring points with an open sky."
Multi-level Governance and Digitalization in Climate Change: A Bibliometric Analysis,"Universitas Muhammadiyah Makassar, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.The purpose of this research is driven by the impact of climate change, which affects many aspects. Several mitigation efforts were made but were considered less than optimal. Multilevel governance adaptation and digitalization are starting to be considered for issues around climate change. This tendency prompted this study to search for available research documents to check on these topics. The method used is a bibliometric analysis by maximizing the Vosviewer analysis tool. The findings of this study indicate that research trends related to multilevel governance have only recently been seriously studied by global researchers because of a change in perspective on the understanding that mitigation that has been implemented thus far is not sufficient to avoid climate change. The arguments then target a new pattern of climate change adaptation by developing policies focusing on multilevel climate change governance. This focus targets intercross-policy development. The topic of digitalization has just begun to be associated with climate change, with arguments for digitalization opportunities that are considered capable of overcoming future sustainable development challenges. Digitalization is projected to be a key supporter of sustainable development with the potential to promote a climate-friendly environment. Future projections of this digitalization approach will likely influence climate change publications. The findings of this study assess the potential for global policy adaptation in climate change mitigation efforts by linking multilevel governance and digitalization simultaneously."
The Effect of Urban Vegetation Patterns on Land Surface Temperatures in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region,Chulalongkorn University,2023,"© 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.Land cover change and climate change lead to rising land surface temperatures. An abundance of research demonstrates that urban vegetation, known as green infrastructure, can reduce land surface temperatures. However, there is little research determining how the spatial structure and pattern of urban vegetation affects land surface temperature. This research focuses on investigating the effects of urban vegetation patterns on land surface temperatures by comparing classification maps, spatial patterns of vegetation, and the land surface temperature contour maps. Eight areas that have similar land cover ratios but different spatial patterns have been selected. The results show that large vegetation patches reduce surface temperature better than small vegetation patches. A large vegetation patch has the ability to decrease surface temperature only in the patch itself, and at a distance of 60–120 m surrounding the patch. However, built-up and bare soil areas that reside next to the green patch still retain a high surface temperature. On the other hand, the maximum temperature of areas comprising the small vegetation patches is lower than the large patch. Overall, small, scattered vegetation patches reduce the surface temperature not only on the patches themselves but also in a wider area. It seems that small, scattered vegetation patches benefit the urban areas by reducing land surface temperature more than a large vegetation patch. However, both large and small, scattered vegetation patches should be combined to most efficiently decreasing urban land surface temperature. The findings of the research can be applied to Bangkok’s green infrastructure planning to improve the quality of life for the people and make the city more resilient."
Insights into the influence of Pd loading on CeO2 catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol,"Hunan University, Ghent University, Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management (GITAM) University Bengaluru, Qatar University, GITAM (Deemed to be University), Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, New Horizon College of Engineering",2023,"© 2023One of the most significant industrial processes is the catalytic methanol synthesis from carbon dioxide because methanol is a future energy carrier for producing fuels and high-value-added commodities, the so-called “methanol economy” is carbon neutral. As a solution to climate change, the widespread belief that carbon dioxide can be recycled by hydrogenation into methanol has motivated the development of more efficient and selective catalysts. Efficient 2 wt% Pd/CeO2 catalysts for thermochemical CO2 hydrogenation have recently been investigated. However, the rationale behind the low Pd loading (2 wt%) in CeO2 needs to be clarified, and comprehensive research into Pd tuning is lacking. In this article, we describe the synthesis ofvarious palladium contents (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 wt%) supported on ceria nanorods (Pd/CeO2) for selective hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol under vapor-phase. The impact of Pd on the physicochemical properties of CeO2 was examined using various characterization techniques. The enhanced catalytic activity was caused by the 2 wt% Pd/CeO2 catalyst's most significant level of metallic Pd species, strong interactions between Pd and CeO2, uniform Pd dispersion on CeO2, increased reducibility, oxygen mobility, and weak basic sites. This study reveals that changing the percentage of metal in the catalyst supports a valuable technique for designing efficient oxides-supported metal-based catalysts for CO2 conversions."
Thermomechanical Analyses of Alkali-Treated Coconut Husk-Bagasse Fiber-Calcium Carbonate Hybrid Composites,"Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, Newcastle University in Singapore, Devan Nair Institute for Employment & Employability, and Research)",2023,"© 2023 by the authors.Natural fiber-reinforced composites can contribute to reducing carbon footprint goals due to their ability to reduce overall product weight, bio-diverse feedstocks, and recyclability potential. In this work, natural fiber-based composites containing the reinforcement of coconut husk and bagasse fiber with calcium carbonate (CaCO3) ingredients were prepared and analyzed. The composites were analyzed for mechanical, thermomechanical, and morphological properties. The reinforcements were chemically functionalized using 5% w/v NaOH to enhance their interactions with the epoxy resins. The chemical functionalization created perforation on the fiber surface, improving the interlocking of fibres with the resin material and strengthening the mechanical performance of the composite. The composites developed using modified reinforcement treatment resulted in increased tensile strength (64.8%) and flexural strength (70%). The reinforcement treatment influenced the hydrophilicity, and the water absorption of treated composites was reduced more than five times compared to the unmodified composites. Scanning electron microscopy revealed morphological changes due to fiber modification, the underlaying mechanism of fiber contraction, and enhanced fiber matrix interface interlocking and adhesion strengthening. Thermal analysis confirmed that alkali treatment improves the crystallinity of the fiber and thereto the degradation temperature of treated fiber composites (both bagasse and coconut husk), which is 375.27◦ C, the highest amongst the developed hybrid composites."

Compared to traditional surveys that are taxa-specific and time-consuming, eDNA metabarcoding offers a rapid, non-invasive and cost-efficient method for monitoring mangrove biodiversity and characterising the spatio-temporal distribution of multiple taxa simultaneously. General guidelines for eDNA metabarcoding are well-established for aquatic systems, but habitat-specific guidelines are still lacking. Mangrove habitats, as priority ecosystems for restoration in Southeast Asia, present unique prospects and challenges in these regards. Environmental DNA metabarcoding can be used to (1) track functional recovery in ecological restoration, (2) prioritise conservation areas, (3) provide early warning for threats, (4) monitor threatened taxa, (5) monitor response to climate change, and (6) support community-based restoration. However, these potential applications have yet been realized in Southeast Asia due to (1) technical challenges, (2) lack of standardised methods, (3) spatio-temporal difficulties in defining community, (4) data limitations, and (5) lack of funding, infrastructure and technical capacity. Successful implementation of eDNA metabarcoding in mangrove restoration activities would encourage the development of data-driven coastal management and equitable conservation programs. Eventually, this would promote Southeast Asia’s shared regional interests in food security, coastal defence and biodiversity conservation."
Thailand Energy Scenarios: Pathways towards Carbon Neutrality 2050,Chulalongkorn University,2023,"© 2023, Econjournals. All rights reserved.“Carbon neutrality” has become a challenging target for the energy sector, which may lead to a major structural redesign of the sector. This may inevitably have an impact on the country’s economic structure. Future policies should be carefully formulated, taking into consideration both the positives and negatives, as well as the short-and long-term effects on the nation’s energy and economy in the future. This will ensure that the nation receives the maximum benefit in terms of energy security, carbon targets, environmental and social care, and sustainable economic growth. The various driving factors to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 were analyzed based on the STEEP analysis, with an emphasis on the energy sector, which is found to make the largest contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. It found that political will, green technology, and financial incentives are the most influential factors in achieving the carbon neutrality target. These factors are considered as critical uncertainties when building two future scenarios for the energy sector. The Classic scenario reflects the attempt to achieve carbon neutrality with an emphasis on clean technologies, such as renewable energy, green hydrogen, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). Meanwhile, the target will become even more challenging when energy efficiency is to be increased, such as electric vehicle. The Orchestra scenario shows how energy management, a decentralized energy system and promoting the prosumer market, especially in the residential sector, are used to try to reach carbon neutrality. In conclusion, both scenarios may result in the achievement of the 2050 carbon neutrality target. The Orchestra scenario may need planning, a holistic management approach, and active cooperation from various sectors. On the contrary, in the Classic scenario, most activities are restricted to the energy sector, which may entail some risks, particularly the rising demand for carbon offsets from other countries."
The Photocatalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Fuels Using Titanium Dioxide Nanosheets/Graphene Oxide Heterostructure as Photocatalyst,"Mahidol University, Mahidol University, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2023 by the authors.Carbon dioxide (CO2) photoreduction to high-value products is a technique for dealing with CO2 emissions. The method involves the molecular transformation of CO2 to hydrocarbon and alcohol-type chemicals, such as methane and methanol, relying on a photocatalyst, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2). In this research, TiO2 nanosheets (TNS) were synthesized using a hydrothermal technique in the presence of a hydrofluoric acid (HF) soft template. The nanosheets were further composited with graphene oxide and doped with copper oxide in the hydrothermal process to create the copper−TiO2 nanosheets/graphene oxide (CTNSG). The CTNSG exhibited outstanding photoactivity in converting CO2 gas to methane and acetone. The production rate for methane and acetone was 12.09 and 0.75 µmol h−1 gcat−1 at 100% relative humidity, providing a total carbon consumption of 71.70 µmol gcat−1. The photoactivity of CTNSG was attributed to the heterostructure interior of the two two−dimensional nanostructures, the copper−TiO2 nanosheets and graphene oxide. The nanosheets−graphene oxide interfaces served as the n−p heterojunctions in holding active radicals for subsequent reactions. The heterostructure also directed the charge transfer, which promoted electron−hole separation in the photocatalyst."
Life Cycle Assessment of Integrated Municipal Organic Waste Management Systems in Thailand,"Mahidol University, Kyoto University, Chulalongkorn University, King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi, Research and Innovation",2023,"© 2022 by the authors.The majority of municipal solid waste in Thailand is organic waste including food and garden waste. Improper waste management has caused negative impacts on the environment. This study aimed to find a hypothetical municipal organic waste management scenario with the lowest environmental impacts using life cycle assessment (LCA). The system boundary of organic waste management includes collection and transportation; treatment, including centralized and on-site treatment technologies; and by-product utilization. The two main waste management systems considered in this study were centralized and on-site waste management systems. The first two scenarios take into account all the amount of the municipal organic waste collected and transported and then treated by centralized waste treatment technologies (composting, anaerobic digestion, and landfill). The remaining three scenarios are integrated between 10% on-site (home composting, food waste processor, and composting bin) and 90% centralized (composting, anaerobic digestion, and incineration) waste treatment technologies; the scenario combining centralized (food waste anaerobic digestion, garden waste composting, and incineration) and on-site (home composting) systems yielded the lowest environmental impacts (except short-term climate change, freshwater, and marine eutrophication). On-site systems can help reduce collection, transportation, and treatment impacts, particularly photochemical oxidant formation, which was proportional to the amount of waste or distance reduced. Benefits from the by-product utilization can offset all impacts in terms of fossil and nuclear energy use and freshwater acidification, and result in a negative impact score or impact reduction. This research can be used as guidance for developing countries with conditions and waste composition similar to Thailand for making initial decisions on environmentally sustainable municipal organic waste management."
Modeling CO2 Emission in Residential Sector of Three Countries in Southeast of Asia by Applying Intelligent Techniques,"University of Pretoria, China Medical University, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), University, University of Tehran, Chulalongkorn University",2023,"© 2023 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.Residential sector is one of the energy-consuming districts of countries that causes CO2 emission in large extent. In this regard, this sector must be considered in energy policy making related to the reduction of emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. In the present work, CO2 emission related to the residential sector of three countries, including Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam in Southeast Asia, are discussed and modeled by employing Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH)andMultilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks as powerful intelligent methods. Prior to modeling, data related to the energy consumption of these countries are represented, discussed, and analyzed. Subsequently, to propose a model, electricity, natural gas, coal, and oil products consumptions are applied as inputs, and CO2 emission is considered as the model's output. The obtained R2 values for the generated models based on MLP and GMDH are 0.9987 and 0.9985, respectively. Furthermore, values of the Average Absolute Relative Deviation (AARD) of the regressions using the mentioned techniques are around 4.56% and 5.53%, respectively. These values reveal significant exactness of the models proposed in this article; however, making use of MLP with the optimal architecture would lead to higher accuracy."
Acute kidney injury in the tropics,"Chulalongkorn University, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Chulalongkorn University, Chiang Mai University, University of Fortaleza, Federal University of Ceara, Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute, Royal Society of Thailand",2023,"© 2022 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.The tropics are a region consisting of more than 125 countries, accounting for 40% of the world's population. The region's population is expected to increase up to 60% in the coming decades. Many tropical countries continue to experience public health problems such as high rates of infectious diseases, lack of sanitation, climate change impacts, poor regulation of herbal medicines and low access to healthcare. These conditions produce the unique problem of tropical acute kidney injury (AKI), which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Tropical infections such as leptospirosis, dengue and malaria have varied mechanisms of AKI, including both direct kidney invasion and indirect effects, depending on the disease characteristics. Animal toxins from snakebites and arthropods along with plant toxins, such as djenkol beans, starfruit and herbal medicine, are characterized by a harmful renal effect from each toxic substance. Environmental factors such as heat stress, natural disasters and chemical compounds also lead to AKI and have a systemic effect from their own pathogenesis. The long-term kidney prognosis varies among these etiologies depending on the cause and severity of disease. However, all these conditions are potentially preventable and treatable. Prompt management and good preventive approaches are needed. This article will focus on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and management of AKI associated with tropical infections, toxins and environment impacts."
"Carbon emissions, corporate governance, and staggered boards","Chulalongkorn University, Chulalongkorn University, The University of Western Australia, Pennsylvania State University",2023,"© 2022 The Authors. Business Strategy and The Environment published by ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Carbon emissions have been identified as a major cause of global warming and are harmful to the environment. Given the seriousness of climate changes, businesses are encouraged to adopt corporate strategies to improve environmental performance. Staggered boards (or classified boards) are one of the controversial corporate governance devices being employed by corporations that protect managers from the market for corporate control. This paper explores whether staggered boards can be a useful business strategy to improve carbon emissions. Relying on a novel data set in which the presence of a staggered board is identified through advanced machine learning algorithms and textual analysis, we find that staggered boards bring about significantly worse emission performance by 10.67%. Our results corroborate the premise that staggered boards insulate self-interested managers from market discipline and thus exacerbate agency problems, resulting in more unfavorable outcomes. Further analysis validates the results, that is, propensity score matching, entropy balancing, instrumental-variable analysis, and generalized method of moments (GMM) dynamic panel data estimation. Importantly, we include firm fixed effects to account for unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings indicate that de-staggered boards may help improve emission performance."
